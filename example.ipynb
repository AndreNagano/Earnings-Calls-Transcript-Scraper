       "    \"Yeah. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. I guess for me, Jensen, as test-time compute and reinforcement learning shows such promise, we're clearly seeing an increasing blurring of the lines between training and inference.\",\n",
       "    'What does this mean for the potential future of potentially inference dedicated clusters? And how do you think about the overall impact to NVIDIA and your customers? Thank you.',\n",
       "    \"Yeah, I appreciate that, C.J. There are now multiple scaling laws. There's the pre-training scaling law, and that's going to continue to scale because we have multimodality, we have data that came from reasoning that are now used to do pretraining. And then the second is post-training skilling, using reinforcement learning human feedback, reinforcement learning AI feedback, reinforcement learning, verifiable rewards.\",\n",
       "    \"The amount of computation you use for post-training is actually higher than pretraining. And it's kind of sensible in the sense that you could, while you're using reinforcement learning, generate an enormous amount of synthetic data or synthetically generated tokens. AI models are basically generating tokens to train AI models. And that's post-trade.\",\n",
       "    \"And the third part, this is the part that you mentioned is test-time compute or reasoning, long thinking, inference scaling. They're all basically the same ideas. And there, you have a chain of thought, you have search. The amount of tokens generated the amount of inference compute needed is already 100x more than the one-shot examples and the one-shot capabilities of large language models in the beginning.\",\n",
       "    'We run every model. We are great at training. The vast majority of our compute today is actually inference and Blackwell takes all of that to a new level. We designed Blackwell with the idea of reasoning models in mind.',\n",
       "    \"And when you look at training, it's many times more performing. But what's really amazing is for long thinking test time scaling, reasoning AI models were tens of times faster, 25x higher throughput. And so, Blackwell is going to be incredible across the board. And when you have a data center that allows you to configure and use your data center based on are you doing more pretraining now, post-training now, or scaling out your inference, our architecture is fungible and easy to use in all of those different ways.\",\n",

       "    'Where are you in terms of that ramp? Are there still bottlenecks to consider at a systems level above and beyond the chip level? And just have you maintained your enthusiasm for the NVL72 platforms?',\n",
       "    \"Well, I'm more enthusiastic today than I was at CES. And the reason for that is because we've shipped a lot more since CES. We have some 350 plants manufacturing the 1.5 million components that go into each one of the Blackwell racks, Grace Blackwell racks. Yes, it's extremely complicated.\",\n",
       "    \"And we successfully and incredibly ramped up Grace Blackwell, delivering some $11 billion of revenues last quarter. We're going to have to continue to scale as demand is quite high, and customers are anxious and impatient to get their Blackwell systems. You've probably seen on the web, a fair number of celebrations about Grace Blackwell systems coming online and we have them, of course.

What is on your dashboard to give you the confidence that the strong demand can sustain into next year? And has DeepSeek and whatever innovations they came up with, has that changed that view in any way? Thank you.\",\n",
       "    'Well, let me first take the first part of the question there regarding the gross margin. During our Blackwell ramp, our gross margins will be in the low 70s. At this point, we are focusing on expediting our manufacturing, expediting our manufacturing to make sure that we can provide to customers as soon as possible. Our Blackwell is fully round.',\n",

       "    'We know several things, Vivek. We have a fairly good line of sight of the amount of capital investment that data centers are building out toward. We know that going forward, the vast majority of software is going to be based on machine learning. And so, accelerated computing and generative AI, reasoning AI are going to be the type of architecture you want in your data center.',\n",
       "    \"Midterm signals would be the level of infrastructure and capex scale-out compared to previous years. And then the long-term signals has to do with the fact that we know fundamentally software has changed from hand-coding that runs on CPUs to machine learning and AI-based software that runs on GPUs and accelerated computing systems. And so, we have a fairly good sense that this is the future of software. And then maybe as you roll it out, another way to think about that is we've really only tapped consumer AI and search and some amount of consumer generative AI, advertising, recommenders, kind of the early days of software.\",\n",
       "    \"The next wave is coming, agentic AI for enterprise, physical AI for robotics, and sovereign AI as different regions build out their AI for their own ecosystems. And so, each one of these are barely off the ground, and we can see them. We can see them because, obviously, we're in the center of much of this development and we can see great activity happening in all these different places and these will happen.

How do your customers and the supply chain also manage the simultaneous ramps of these two products? And is the team still on track to execute Blackwell Ultra in the second half of this year?\",\n",
       "    \"Yes. Blackwell Ultra is second half. As you know, the first Blackwell was we had a hiccup that probably cost us a couple of months. We're fully recovered, of course.\",\n",
       "    \"The team did an amazing job recovering and all of our supply chain partners and just so many people helped us recover at the speed of light. And so, now we've successfully ramped production of Blackwell. But that doesn't stop the next train. The next train is on an annual rhythm and Blackwell Ultra with new networking, new memories, and of course, new processors, and all of that is coming online.\",\n",
       "    \"We have been working with all of our partners and customers, laying this out. They have all of the necessary information, and we'll work with everybody to do the proper transition. This time between Blackwell and Blackwell Ultra, the system architecture is exactly the same. It's a lot harder going from Hopper to Blackwell because we went from an NVLink 8 system to an NVLink 72-based system.\",\n",
       "    \"So, the chassis, the architecture of the system, the hardware, the power delivery, all of that had to change. This was quite a challenging transition. But the next transition will slot right in Blackwell Ultra will slot right in. We've also already revealed and been working very closely with all of our partners on the click after that.\",\n",
       "    \"And the click after that is called Vera Rubin and all of our partners are getting up to speed on the transition of that and so preparing for that transition. And again, we're going to provide a big, huge step-up. And so, come to GTC, and I'll talk to you about Blackwell Ultra, Vera Rubin and then show you what we place after that.

       "    'Thanks a lot. Jensen, we heard a lot about custom ASICs. Can you kind of speak to the balance between customer ASIC and merchant GPU? We hear about some of these heterogeneous superclusters to use both GPU and ASIC. Is that something customers are planning on building? Or will these infrastructures remain fairly distinct? Thanks.',\n",
       "    \"So, we're general, we're end-to-end, and we're everywhere. And because we're not in just one cloud, we're in every cloud, we could be on-prem. We could be in a robot. Our architecture is much more accessible and a great target initial target for anybody who's starting up a new company.\",\n",
       "    \"And so, we're everywhere. And the third thing I would say is that our performance in our rhythm is so incredibly fast. Remember that these data centers are always fixed in size. They're fixed in size or they're fixing power.\",\n",
       "    'And if our performance per watt is anywhere from 2x to 4x to 8x, which is not unusual, it translates directly to revenues. And so, if you have a 100-megawatt data center, if the performance or the throughput in that 100-megawatt or the gigawatt data center is four times or eight times higher, your revenues for that gigawatt data center is eight times higher. And the reason that is so different than data centers of the past is because AI factories are directly monetizable through its tokens generated. And so, the token throughput of our architecture being so incredibly fast is just incredibly valuable to all of the companies that are building these things for revenue generation reasons and capturing the fast ROI.',\n",
       "    'And so, I think the third reason is performance. And then the last thing that I would say is the software stack is incredibly hard. Building an ASIC is no different than what we do. We build a new architecture.',\n",
       "    \"And then finally, I will say this, just because the chip is designed doesn't mean it gets deployed. And you've seen this over and over again. There are a lot of chips that get built, but when the time comes, a business decision has to be made, and that business decision is about deploying a new engine, a new processor into a limited AI factory in size, in power, and in fine. And our technology is not only more advanced, more performance, it has much, much better software capability and very importantly, our ability to deploy is lightning fast.\",\n",

And so, the second part is how do we see the growth of enterprise or not CSPs, if you will, going forward? And the answer is, I believe, long term, it is by far larger and the reason for that is because if you look at the computer industry today and what is not served by the computer industry is largely industrial.\",\n",

On the back of this, we've had investors ask about your ability to execute to the road map you presented at GTC this year with Ultra coming out next year and the transition to Rubin in '26. Can you sort of speak to that? And some investors are questioning that, so if you can sort of speak to your ability to execute on time, that would be super helpful. And then a quick part B.\",\n",
       "    \"On supply constraints, is it a multitude of componentry that's causing this, or is it specifically HBN? Is it supply constraints? Are the supply constraints getting better? Are they worsening? Any sort of color on that would be super helpful as well. Thank you.\",\n",
       "    \"Yeah. Thanks. So, let's see. Back to the first question.\",\n",
       "    \"Blackwell production is in full steam. In fact, as Colette mentioned earlier, we will deliver this quarter more Blackwells than we had previously estimated. And so, the supply chain team is doing an incredible job working with our supply partners to increase Blackwell, and we're going to continue to work hard to increase Blackwell through next year. It is the case that demand exceeds our supply.\",\n",
       "    \"And that's expected as we're in the beginnings of this generative AI revolution as we all know. And we're at the beginning of a new generation of foundation models that are able to do reasoning and able to do long thinking. And of course, one of the really exciting areas is physical AI, AI that now understands the structure of the physical world. And so, Blackwell demand is very strong.\",\n",
       "    \"Our execution is going well. And there's obviously a lot of engineering that we're doing across the world. You see now systems that are being stood up by Dell and CoreWeave. I think you saw systems from Oracle stood up.\",\n",
       "    \"You have systems from Microsoft, and they're about to preview their Grace Blackwell systems. You have systems that are at Google. And so, all of these CSPs are racing to be first. The engineering that we do with them is, as you know, rather complicated.\",\n",
       "    \"And the reason for that is because, although we build full stack and full infrastructure, we disaggregate all of this AI supercomputer, and we integrate it into all of the custom data centers and architectures around the world. That integration process, it's something we've done several generations now. We're very good at it but still there's still a lot of engineering that happens at this point. But as you see from all of the systems that are being stood up, Blackwell is in great shape.\",\n",
       "    \"And as we mentioned earlier, the supply and what we're planning to ship this quarter is greater than our previous estimates. With respect to the supply chain, there are seven different chips, seven custom chips that we built in order for us to deliver the Blackwell systems. The Blackwell systems go in air-cooled or liquid-cooled, NVLink 8 or NVLink 72 or NVLink 8, NVLink 36, NVLink 72. We have x86 or Grace.\",\n",
       "    \"And the integration of all of those systems into the world's data centers is nothing short of a miracle. And so, the component supply chain necessary to ramp at this scale, you have to go back and take a look at how much Blackwell we shipped last quarter, which was zero. And in terms of how much Blackwell total systems will ship this quarter, which is measured in billions, the ramp is incredible. And so almost every company in the world seems to be involved in our supply chain.\",\n",
       "    \"And we've got great partners, everybody from, of course, TSMC and Amphenol, the connector company, incredible company; Vertiv and SK Hynix and Micron; Spill Amcor; KYEC; and there's Foxconn and the factories that they've built; and Quanta and Wiwynn; and, gosh, Dell and HP, and Super Micro, Lenovo. And the number of companies is just really quite incredible. Quanta. And I'm sure I've missed partners that are involved in the ramping of Blackwell, which I really appreciate.\",\n",
       "    \"And so, anyways, I think we're in great shape with respect to the Blackwell ramp at this point. And then lastly, your question about our execution of our road map. We're on an annual road map and we're expecting to continue to execute on our annual road map. And by doing so, we increased the performance, of course, of our platform.\",\n",
       "    \"But it's also really important to realize that when we're able to increase performance and do so at factors at a time, we're reducing the cost of training. We're reducing the cost of inferencing. We're reducing the cost of AI so that it could be much more accessible. But the other factor that's very important to note is that when there's a data center of some fixed size and the data center always is of some fixed size.\",\n",
       "    'But on the other hand, because our perf per watt is so good compared to anything out there, we generate for our customers the greatest possible revenues. And so, that annual rhythm is really important to us, and we have every intention of continuing to do that. And everything is on track as far as I know.',\n",
       "    'Your next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri of UBS. Your line is open.',\n",
       "    \"But I think in recent months also, you said that Blackwell crosses over Hopper in the April quarter. So, I guess I had two questions. First of all, is that still the right way to think about it, that Blackwell will cross over Hopper in April? And then Colette, you kind of talked about Blackwell bringing down gross margin to the low 70s as it ramps. So, I guess if April is the crossover, is that the worst of the pressure on gross margin? So, you're going to be kind of in the low 70s as soon as April.\",\n",
       "    \"I'm just wondering if you can sort of shape that for us. Thanks.\",\n",
       "    \"Colette, why don't you start?\",\n",
       "    'Sure. Let me first start with your question, Tim, thank you, regarding our gross margins. And we discussed that our gross margins, as we are ramping Blackwell in the very beginning, and the many different configurations, the many different chips that we are bringing to market, we are going to focus on making sure we have the best experience for our customers as they stand that up. We will start growing into our gross margins, but we do believe those will be in the low 70s in that first program.',\n",
       "    \"So, you're correct, as you look at the quarters following after that, we will start increasing our gross margins, and we hope to get to the mid-70s quite quickly as part of that round.\",\n",
       "    \"Hopper demand will continue through next year, surely the first several quarters of the next year. And meanwhile, we will ship more Blackwells next quarter than this, and we'll ship more Blackwells the quarter after that than our first quarter. And so, that kind of puts it in perspective. We are really at the beginnings of two fundamental shifts in computing that is really quite significant.\",\n",
       "    'The first is moving from coding that runs on CPUs to machine learning that creates neural networks that runs on GPUs. And that fundamental shift from coding to machine learning is widespread at this point. There are no companies who are not going to do machine learning. And so, machine learning is also what enables generative AI.',\n",
       "    \"Just like we generate electricity, we're now going to be generating AI. And if the number of customers is large, just as the number of consumers of electricity is large, these generators are going to be running 24/7. And today, many AI services are running 24/7, just like an AI factory. And so, we're going to see this new type of system come online, and I call it an AI factory because that's really as close to what it is.\",\n",
       "    \"It's unlike a data center of the past. And so, these two fundamental trends are really just beginning. And so, we expect this to happen, this growth, this modernization, and the creation of a new industry to go on for several years.\",\n",
       "    'Your next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya of Bank of America Securities. Your line is open.',\n",
       "    \"Thanks for taking my question. Colette, just to clarify, do you think it's a fair assumption to think NVIDIA could recover to kind of mid-70s gross margin in the back half of calendar '25? Just wanted to clarify that. And then Jensen, my main question, historically, when we have seen hardware deployment cycles, they have inevitably included some digestion along the way. When do you think we get to that phase? Or is it just too premature to discuss that because you're just at the start of Blackwell? So, how many quarters of shipments do you think is required to kind of satisfy this first wave? Can you continue to grow this into calendar '26? Just how should we be prepared to see what we have seen historically, right, a period of digestion along the way of a long-term kind of secular hardware deployment?\",\n",
       "    \"OK. Vivek, thank you for the question. Let me clarify your question regarding gross margins. Could we reach the mid-70s in the second half of next year? And yes, I think it is a reasonable assumption or goal for us to do, but we'll just have to see how that mix of ramp goes.\",\n",
       "    'But yes, it is definitely possible.',\n",
       "    \"And so, what's going to happen over the course of the next X number of years, and let's assume that over the course of four years, the world's data centers could be modernized as we grow into IT, as you know, IT continues to grow about 20%, 30% a year, let's say. But let's say by 2030, the world's data centers for computing is, call it, a couple of trillion dollars. We have to grow into that. We have to modernize the data center from coding to machine learning.\",\n",
       "    \"That's number one. The second part of it is generative AI. And we're now producing a new type of capability the world's never known, a new market segment that the world's never had. If you look at OpenAI, it didn't replace anything.\",\n",
       "    \"It's something that's completely brand new. It's, in a lot of ways as when the iPhone came, was completely brand new. It wasn't really replacing anything. And so, we're going to see more and more companies like that.\",\n",
       "    \"And they're going to create and generate, out of their services, essentially intelligence. Some of it would be digital artist intelligence like Runway. Some of it would be basic intelligence like OpenAI. Some of it would be legal intelligence like Harvey, digital marketing intelligence like Rider's, so on and so forth.\",\n",
       "    \"Now, they're AI natives. And so, these companies are being created because people see that there's a platform shift, and there's a brand-new opportunity to do something completely new. And so, my sense is that we're going to continue to build out to modernize IT, modernize computing, number one; and then number two, create these AI factories that are going to be for a new industry for the production of artificial intelligence.\",\n",
       "    'Your next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon of Bernstein Research. Your line is open.',\n",
       "    \"Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Colette, I had a clarification and a question for you. The clarification, just when you say low 70s gross margins, does 73.5% count as low 70s, or do you have something else in mind? And for my question, you're guiding total revenues, and so I mean, total data center revenues in the next quarter must be up several billion dollars.\",\n",
       "    'But it sounds like Blackwell now should be up more than that. But you also said Hopper was still strong, so like is Hopper down sequentially next quarter? And if it is, like why? Is it because of the supply constraints? China has been pretty strong. Is China is kind of rolling off a bit into Q4? So any color you can give us on sort of the Blackwell ramp and the Blackwell versus Hopper behavior into Q4 would be really helpful. Thank you.',\n",
       "    \"So, first, starting on your first question there, Stacy, regarding our gross margin and define low. Low, of course, is below the mids, and let's say we might be at 71%, maybe about 72%, 72.5%. We're going to be in that range. We could be higher than that as well.\",\n",
       "    \"We're just going to have to see how it comes through. We do want to make sure that we are ramping and continuing that improvement, the improvement in terms of our yields, the improvement in terms of the product as we go through the rest of the year, so we'll get up to the mid-70s by that point. The second statement was a question regarding our Hopper and what is our Hopper doing. We have seen substantial growth for H200 not only in terms of orders but the quickness in terms of those that are standing that out.\",\n",
       "    \"It is an amazing product and it's the fastest growing and ramping that we've seen. We will continue to be selling Hopper in this quarter, in Q4 for sure. That is across the board in terms of all of our different configurations, and our configurations include what we may do in terms of China. But keep that in mind that folks are also, at the same time, looking to build out their Blackwell.\",\n",
       "    \"So, we've got a little bit of both happening in Q4. But yes. Is it possible for Hopper to grow between Q3 and Q4? It's possible, but we'll just have to see.\",\n",
       "    'Your next question comes from the line of Joseph Moore of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.',\n",
       "    \"Great. Thank you. I wonder if you could talk a little bit about what you're seeing in the inference market. You've talked about Strawberry and some of the ramifications of longer scaling influence projects.\",\n",
       "    \"But you've also talked about the possibility that as some of these Hopper clusters age, that you could use some of the Hopper chips for inference. So, I guess do you expect inference to outgrow training in the next kind of 12 months time frame? And just generally, your thoughts there.\",\n",
       "    \"Our hopes and dreams is that someday, the world does a ton of inference. And that's when AI has really exceeded is when every single company is doing inference inside their companies for the marketing department and forecasting department and supply chain group and their legal department and engineering, of course, and coding of course. And so, we hope that every company is doing inference 24/7 and that there will be a whole bunch of AI native start-ups, thousands of AI native start-ups that are generating tokens and generating AI. And every aspect of your computer experience from using Outlook to PowerPointing or when you're sitting there with Excel, you're constantly generating tokens.\",\n",
       "    \"And every time you read a PDF, open a PDF, it generated a whole bunch of tokens. One of my favorite applications is NotebookLM, this Google application that came out. I used the living daylights out of it just because it's fun. And I put every PDF, every archived paper into it just to listen to it as well as scanning through it.\",\n",
       "    \"And so, I think that's the goal is to train these models so that people use it. And there's now a whole new era of AI, if you will, a whole new genre of AI called physical AI. Just those large language models understand the human language and how the thinking process, if you will. Physical AI understands the physical world.\",\n",
       "    \"And it understands the meaning of the structure and understands what's sensible and what's not and what could happen and what won't. And not only does it understand but it can predict, roll out a short future. That capability is incredibly valuable for industrial AI and robotics. And so, that's fired up so many AI-native companies and robotics companies and physical AI companies that you're probably hearing about.\",\n",
       "    'Inference is super hard. And the reason why inference is super hard is because you need the accuracy to be high on the one hand. You need the throughput to be high so that the cost could be as low as possible, but you also need the latency to be low. And computers that are high-throughput as well as low latency is incredibly hard to build.',\n",
       "    \"And these applications have long context lengths because they want to understand. They want to be able to inference within understanding the context of what they're being asked to do. And so, the context length is growing larger and larger. On the other hand, the models are getting larger.\",\n",
       "    \"And if something were to happen, it's probably likely their code and not ours. And so, that ability to innovate in every single direction at the same time, having a large installed base so that whatever you create could land on an NVIDIA computer and be deployed broadly all around the world in every single data center all the way out to the edge into robotic systems, that capability is really quite phenomenal.\",\n",

Can you provide an update on that? And then can you explain the supply constrained situation in gaming? Is that because you're shifting your supply toward data center?\",\n",
       "    \"So, first, starting in terms of sovereign AI, such an important part of growth, something that is really surfaced with the onset of generative AI and building models in the individual countries around the world. And we see a lot of them, and we talked about a lot of them on the call today and the work that they are doing. So, our sovereign AI and our pipeline going forward is still absolutely intact as those are working to build these foundational models in their own language, in their own culture, and working in terms of the enterprises within those countries. And I think you'll continue to see this be growth opportunities that you may see with our regional clouds that are being stood up and/or those that are focusing in terms of AI factories for many parts of the sovereign AI.\",\n",

Let me flip to your second question that you asked regarding Gaming. So, our Gaming right now from a supply, we're busy trying to make sure that we can ramp all of our different products. And in this case, our gaming supply, given what we saw selling through was moving quite fast.\",\n",
       "    \"Now, the challenge that we have is how fast could we get that supply getting ready into the market for this quarter. Not to worry, I think we'll be back on track with more supply as we turn the corner into the new calendar year. We're just going to be tight for this quarter.\",\n",

       "    \"Hey, thanks for taking my question. Jensen, you mentioned in your comments, you have the pretraining, the actual language models and you have reinforcement learning that becomes more and more important in training and inference as well and then you have inference itself. And I was wondering if you have a sense like a high-level typical sense of out of an overall AI ecosystem, like maybe one of your clients or one of the large models that are out there today, how much of the compute goes into each of these buckets? How much for the pretraining? How much for the reinforcement? And how much into inference today? Do you have any sense for how it's splitting and where the growth is the most important as well?\",\n",
       "    \"Well, today, it's vastly in pretraining a foundation model because, as you know, post-training, the new technologies are just coming online. And whatever you could do in pretraining and post-training, you would try to do so that the inference cost could be as low as possible for everyone. However, there are only so many things that you could do a priority. And so, you'll always have to do on-the-spot thinking and in-context thinking and reflection.\",\n",
       "    \"And so, I think that the fact that all three are scaling is actually very sensible based on where we are. And in the area foundation model, now we have multimodality foundation models, and the amount of petabytes video that these foundation models are going to be trained on, it's incredible. And so, my expectation is that for the foreseeable future, we're going to be scaling pretraining, post-training, as well as inference time scaling and which is the reason why I think we're going to need more and more compute. And we're going to have to drive as hard as we can to keep increasing the performance by X factors out of time so that we can continue to drive down the cost and continue to increase the revenues and get the AI revolution going.\",\n",

       "    \"And so, if we don't have a new approach, computing inflation would be driving up the cost for every company, and it would be driving up the energy consumption of data centers around the world. In fact, you're seeing that. And so, the answer is accelerated computing. We know that accelerated computing, of course, speeds up applications.\",\n",
       "    \"It also enables you to do computing at a much larger scale, for example, scientific simulations or database processing, but what that translates directly to is lower cost and lower energy consumed. And in fact, this week, there's a blog that came out that talked about a whole bunch of new libraries that we offer. And that's really the core of the first platform transition, going from general-purpose computing to accelerated computing. And it's not unusual to see someone save 90% of their computing cost.\",\n",
       "    \"It's a fundamental new way of doing software. Instead of human-engineered algorithms, we now have data. We tell the AI, we tell the model, we tell the computer what are the expected answers. What are our previous observations? And then for it to figure out what the algorithm is, what's the function.\",\n",
       "    \"It's a fundamental new form of computer science. It's affecting how every layer of computing is done from CPU to GPU, from human-engineered algorithms to machine-learned algorithms, and the type of applications you could now develop and produce is fundamentally remarkable. And there are several things that are happening in generative AI. So, the first thing that's happening is the frontier models are growing in quite substantial scale.\",\n",
       "    'So, we have to continue to drive the generational performance up quite significantly so we can drive down the energy consumed and drive down the cost necessary to do it. And so, the first one is there are larger frontier models trained on more modalities. And surprisingly, there are more frontier model makers than last year. And so, you have more and more and more.',\n",
       "    \"That's one of the dynamics going on in generative AI. The second is although it's below the tip of the iceberg, what we see are ChatGPT image generators. We see coding. We use generative AI for coding quite extensively here at NVIDIA now.\",\n",
       "    \"So, recommender systems, ad generation, custom ad generation targeting ads at very large scale and quite hyper-targeting, search, and user-generated content, these are all very large-scale applications have now evolved to generative AI. Of course, the number of generative AI start-ups is generating tens of billions of dollars of cloud renting opportunities for our cloud partners. And sovereign AI, countries that are now realizing that their data is their natural and national resource and they have to use AI, build their own AI infrastructure so that they could have their own digital intelligence. Enterprise AI, as Colette mentioned earlier, is starting, and you might have seen our announcement that the world's leading IT companies are joining us to take the NVIDIA AI Enterprise platform to the world's enterprises.\",\n",

So, more and more excitement around these models and what they can be specific for those countries. So, yes, we are seeing some growth opportunity in front of us.',\n",

And can you talk about the transition to Blackwell? Do you see people intermixing clusters? Do you think most of the Blackwell activities, new clusters? Just some sense of what that transition looks like.\",\n",
       "    \"Yeah. Thanks, Joe. The demand for Hopper is really strong. And it's true, the demand for Blackwell is incredible.\",\n",
       "    \"There's a couple of reasons for that. The first reason is if you just look at the world's cloud service providers, the amount of GPU capacity they have available, it's basically none. And the reason for that is because they're either being deployed internally for accelerating their own workloads, data processing, for example. Data processing, we hardly ever talk about it because it's mundane.\",\n",
       "    \"It's not very cool because it doesn't generate a picture or generate words. But almost every single company in the world processes data in the background. And NVIDIA's GPUs are the only accelerators on the planet that process and accelerate data. SQL data, Panda's data, data science toolkits like Panda's, and the new one, Polar's.\",\n",
       "    \"The second is, of course, the rentals. They're renting capacity to model makers. They're renting it to start-up companies. And a generative AI company spends the vast majority of their invested capital into infrastructure so that they could use an AI to help them create products.\",\n",
       "    'The second person who gets there is incrementally better or about the same. And so, the ability to systematically and consistently race to the next plateau and be the first one there is how you establish leadership. NVIDIA is constantly doing that, and we show that to the world and the GPUs we make and the AI factories that we make, the networking systems that we make, the SoCs we create. I mean, we want to set the pace.',\n",
       "    \"We want to be consistently the world's best. And that's the reason why we drive ourselves so hard.

And so, between now and then is a lot of generative AI market dynamic.\",\n",
       "    \"And so, everybody is just really in a hurry. It's either operational reasons that they need it. They need accelerated computing. They don't want to build any more general-purpose computing infrastructure and even Hopper.\",\n",
       "    \"Of course, H200 is state-of-the-art. Hopper, if you have a choice between building CPU infrastructure right now for business or Hopper infrastructure for business right now, that decision is relatively clear. And so, I think people are just clamoring to transition the $1 trillion of established installed infrastructure to a modern infrastructure and Hopper's state-of-the-art.\",\n",

       "    \"But what I'm having discussions about is with like the percentage of folks that you see that are spending all of this money and looking to sort of push the frontier toward AGI convergence and, as you just said, a new plateau in capability, and they're going to spend regardless to get to that level of capability because it opens up so many doors for the industry and for their company versus customers that are really, really focused today on capex versus ROI. I don't know if that distinction makes sense. I'm just trying to get a sense of how you're seeing the priorities of people that are putting the dollars in the ground on this new technology and what their priorities are and their time frames are for that investment. Thanks.\",\n",
       "    \"You have $1 trillion worth of general-purpose computing infrastructure. And the question is, do you want to build more of that or not? And for every $1 billion worth of Juniper CPU-based infrastructure that you stand up, you probably rent it for less than $1 billion. And so, because it's commoditized, there's already $1 trillion on the ground. What's the point of getting more? And so, the people who are clamoring to get this infrastructure, one, when they build out Hopper-based infrastructure and soon, Blackwell-based infrastructure, they start saving money.\",\n",
       "    \"That's a tremendous return on investment. And the reason why they start saving money is because data processing saves money, and data processing is probably just a giant part of it already. And so, recommender systems save money, so on and so forth, OK? And so, you start saving money. The second thing is everything you stand up are going to get rented because so many companies are being founded to create generative AI.\",\n",
       "    \"And so, your capacity gets rented right away and the return on investment of that is really good. And then the third reason is your own business. Do you want to either create the next frontier yourself or your own Internet services benefit from a next-generation ad system or a next-generation recommender system or a next-generation search system? So, for your own services, for your own stores, for your own user-generated content, social media platforms, for your own services, generative AI is also a fast ROI. And so, there's a lot of ways you could think through it.\",\n",
       "    \"But at the core, it's because it is the best computing infrastructure you could put in the ground today. The world of general-purpose computing is shifting to accelerated computing. The world of human-engineered software is moving to generative AI software. If you were to build infrastructure to modernize your cloud and your data centers, build it with accelerated computing NVIDIA.\",\n",

But Jensen, is that something to consider sort of on the shape of how Blackwell is going to ramp? And then I guess when you look beyond next year, which is obviously going to be a great year and you look into '26, do you worry about any other gating factors like, say, the power supply chain or at some point, models start to get smaller? I'm just wondering if you can speak to that. Thanks.\",\n",
       "    \"I'm going to work backwards. I really appreciate the question, Tim. So, remember, the world is moving from general-purpose computing to accelerated computing. And the world builds about $1 trillion worth of data centers.\",\n",
       "    \"$1 trillion worth of data centers in a few years will be all accelerated computing. In the past, no GPUs are in data centers, just CPUs. In the future, every single data center will have GPUs. And the reason for that is very clear: because we need to accelerate workloads so that we can continue to be sustainable, continue to drive down the cost of computing so that when we do more computing, we don't experience computing inflation.\",\n",
       "    \"Second, we need GPUs for a new computing model called generative AI that we could all acknowledge is going to be quite transformative to the future of computing. And so, I think working backwards, the way to think about that is the next $1 trillion of the world's infrastructure will clearly be different than the last $1 trillion, and it will be vastly accelerated. With respect to the shape of our ramp, we offer multiple configurations of Blackwell. Blackwell comes in either a Blackwell classic, if you will, that uses the HGX form factor that we pioneered with Volta.\",\n",

If I have mid-70s for the year, let's say, where I want to draw that, if I have 75 for the year, I'd be something like 71 to 72 for Q4, somewhere in that range. Is that the kind of exit rate for gross margins that you're expecting? And how should we think about the drivers of gross margin evolution into next year as Blackwell ramps? And I mean, hopefully, I guess the yields and the inventory reserves and everything come up.\",\n",
       "    \"So, Stacy, let's first take your question that you had about Hopper and Blackwell. So, we believe our Hopper will continue to grow into the second half. We have many new products for Hopper, our existing products for Hopper that we believe will start continuing to ramp in the next quarters, including our Q3 and those new products moving to Q4. So, let's say, Hopper there for versus H1 is a growth opportunity for that.\",\n",

So, what you're seeing there is sometimes just a swift shift in terms of who they are using to complete their full configuration before those things are going into the data center, going into notebooks and those pieces of it. And that shift happens from time to time. But yes, our China number there are invoicing to China.\",\n",

And so, we're going to drive ourselves really hard to continue to go up that scale.\",\n",
       "    \"Well, yes. So, anyways, that's the reason why.\",\n",
       "    'And your final question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.',\n",
       "    'Yes. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to go back into the Blackwell product cycle. One of the questions that we tend to get asked is how you see the rack scale system mix dynamic as you think about leveraging NVLink, you think about GB NVL72 and how that go-to-market dynamic looks as far as the Blackwell product cycle.',\n",
       "    'I guess to put it simply, how do you see that mix of rack scale systems as we start to think about the Blackwell cycle playing out?',\n",
       "    \"Yeah. Aaron, thanks. The Blackwell rack system, it's designed and architected as a rack but it's sold in disaggregated system components. We don't sell the whole rack.\",\n",
       "    \"And the reason for that is because everybody's rack's a little different surprisingly. Some of them are OCP standards, some of them are not. Some of them are enterprise. And the power limits for everybody could be a little different.\",\n",
       "    \"Choice of CDUs, the choice of power bus bars, the configuration and integration into people's data centers, all different. And so, the way we designed it, we architected the whole rack. The software is going to work perfectly across the whole rack. And then we provide the system components.\",\n",
       "    \"Like for example, the CPU and GPU compute board is then integrated into an MGX. It's a modular system architecture. MGX is completely ingenious. And we have MGX ODMs and integrators and OEMs all over the plant.\",\n",
       "    \"And so, just about any configuration you would like, where you would like that 3,000-pound rack to be delivered, it's got to be close to. It has to be integrated and assembled close to the data center because it's fairly heavy. And so everything from the supply chain from the moment that we ship the GPU, CPUs, the switches, the NICs, from that point forward, the integration is done quite close to the location of the CSPs and the locations of the data centers. And so, you can imagine how many data centers in the world there are and how many logistics hubs we've scaled out to with our ODM partners.\",\n",
       "    \"And so, I think because we show it as one rack and because it's always rendered that way and shown that way, we might have left the impression that we're doing the integration. Our customers hate that we do integration. The supply chain hates us doing integration. They want to do the integration.\",\n",
       "    \"That's their value-add. There's a final design-in, if you will. It's not quite as simple as shimmy into a data center but the design fit-in is really complicated. And so, the design fit-in, the installation, the bring-up, the repair and replace, that entire cycle is done all over the world.\",\n",
       "    \"And we have a sprawling network of ODM and OEM partners that does this incredibly well. So, integration is not the reason why we're doing racks. It's the anti-reason of doing it. The way we don't want to be an integrator, we want to be a technology provider.\",\n",
       "    'And I will now turn the call back over to Jensen Huang for closing remarks.',\n",
       "    'Let me highlight the top five things, the top five things of our company. Accelerated computing has reached the tipping point. CPU scaling slows. Developers must accelerate everything possible.',\n",
       "    'Accelerated computing starts with CUDA-X libraries. New libraries open new markets for NVIDIA. We released many new libraries, including CUDA-X Accelerated Polars, Pandas, and Spark, the leading data science and data processing libraries, CUVI-S for vector databases. This is incredibly hot right now.',\n",

Parabricks for gene sequencing and AlphaFold2 for protein structure prediction is now CUDA accelerated. We are at the beginning of our journey to modernize $1 trillion worth of data centers from general-purpose computing to accelerated computing. That's number one.\",\n",
       "    \"Number two, Blackwall is a step-function leap over Hopper. Blackwell is an AI infrastructure platform, not just the GPU. Also happens to be the name of our GPU but it's an AI infrastructure platform. As we reveal more of Blackwell and sample systems to our partners and customers, the extent of Blackwell's lead becomes clear.\",\n",
       "    'The Blackwell vision took nearly five years and seven one-of-a-kind chips to realize, the Gray CPU, the Blackwell dual GPU, and a colos package, ConnectX DPU for East-West traffic, BlueField DPU for North-South and storage traffic, NVLink switch for all-to-all GPU communications, and Quantum and Spectrum-X for both InfiniBand and Ethernet can support the massive traffic of AI. Blackwell AI factories are building-size computers. NVIDIA designed and optimized the Blackwell platform, full stack end to end, from chips, systems, networking, even structured cables, power and cooling, and mounds of software to make it fast for customers to build AI factories. These are very capital-intensive infrastructures.',\n",
       "    'Customers want to deploy it as soon as they get their hands on the equipment and deliver the best performance and TCO. Blackwell provides three to five times more AI throughput in a power-limited data center than Hopper. The third is NVLink. This is a very big deal with its all-to-all GPU switch is game-changing.',\n",
       "    \"The Blackwell system lets us connect 144 GPUs in 72 GB200 packages into one NVLink domain, with an aggregate NVLink bandwidth of 259 terabytes per second in one rack. Just to put that in perspective, that's about 10x higher than Hopper. 259 terabytes per second kind of makes sense because you need to boost the training of multitrillion-parameter models on trillions of tokens. And so, that natural amount of data needs to be moved around from GPU to GPU.\",\n",
       "    \"For inference, NVLink is vital for low-latency, high-throughput large language model token generation. We now have three networking platforms, NVLink for GPU scale-up, Quantum InfiniBand for supercomputing and dedicated AI factories, and Spectrum-X for AI on Ethernet. NVIDIA's networking footprint is much bigger than before. Generative AI momentum is accelerating.\",\n",
       "    \"Generative AI frontier model makers are racing to scale to the next AI plateau to increase model safety and IQ. We're also scaling to understand more modalities from text, images, and video to 3D physics, chemistry, and biology. Chatbots, coding AIs, and image generators are growing fast but it's just the tip of the iceberg. Internet services are deploying generative AI for large-scale recommenders, ad targeting, and search systems.\",\n",

       "    'Thanks, Simona. Q1 was another record quarter. Revenue of $26 billion was up 18% sequentially and up 262% year on year and well above our outlook of $24 billion. Starting with Data Center.',\n",
       "    'Data Center revenue of $22.6 billion was a record, up 23% sequentially and up 427% year on year, driven by continued strong demand for the NVIDIA Hopper GPU computing platform. Compute revenue grew more than 5x and networking revenue more than 3x from last year. Strong sequential Data Center growth was driven by all customer types, led by enterprise and consumer Internet companies. Large cloud providers continue to drive strong growth as they deploy and ramp NVIDIA AI infrastructure at scale and represented the mid-40s as a percentage of our Data Center revenue.',\n",
       "    \"Training and inferencing AI on NVIDIA CUDA is driving meaningful acceleration in cloud rental revenue growth, delivering an immediate and strong return on cloud providers' investment. For every $1 spent on NVIDIA AI infrastructure, cloud providers have an opportunity to earn $5 in GPU instant hosting revenue over four years. NVIDIA's rich software stack and ecosystem and tight integration with cloud providers makes it easy for end customers up and running on NVIDIA GPU instances in the public cloud. For cloud rental customers, NVIDIA GPUs offer the best time-to-train models, the lowest cost to train models, and the lowest cost to inference large language models.\",\n",
       "    \"For public cloud providers, NVIDIA brings customers to their cloud, driving revenue growth and returns on their infrastructure investments. Leading LLM companies such as OpenAI, Adept, Anthropic, Character.ai, Cohere, Databricks, DeepMind, Meta, Mistral, XAi, and many others are building on NVIDIA AI in the cloud. Enterprises drove strong sequential growth in Data Center this quarter. We supported Tesla's expansion of their training AI cluster to 35,000 H100 GPUs.\",\n",
       "    'Their use of NVIDIA AI infrastructure paved the way for the breakthrough performance of FSD version 12, their latest autonomous driving software based on Vision. NVIDIA Transformers, while consuming significantly more computing, are enabling dramatically better autonomous driving capabilities and propelling significant growth for NVIDIA AI infrastructure across the automotive industry. We expect automotive to be our largest enterprise vertical within Data Center this year, driving a multibillion revenue opportunity across on-prem and cloud consumption. Consumer Internet companies are also a strong growth vertical.',\n",
       "    \"A big highlight this quarter was Meta's announcement of Llama 3, their latest large language model, which was trained on a cluster of 24,000 H100 GPUs. Llama 3 powers Meta AI, a new AI assistant available on Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Messenger. Llama 3 is openly available and has kick-started a wave of AI development across industries. As generative AI makes its way into more consumer Internet applications, we expect to see continued growth opportunities as inference scales both with model complexity as well as with the number of users and number of queries per user, driving much more demand for AI compute.\",\n",
       "    'In our trailing four quarters, we estimate that inference drove about 40% of our Data Center revenue. Both training and inference are growing significantly. Large clusters like the ones built by Meta and Tesla are examples of the essential infrastructure for AI production, what we refer to as AI factories. These next-generation data centers host advanced full-stack accelerated computing platforms where the data comes in and intelligence comes out.',\n",
       "    \"In Q1, we worked with over 100 customers building AI factories ranging in size from hundreds to tens of thousands of GPUs, with some reaching 100,000 GPUs. From a geographic perspective, Data Center revenue continues to diversify as countries around the world invest in sovereign AI. Sovereign AI refers to a nation's capabilities to produce artificial intelligence using its own infrastructure, data, workforce, and business networks. Nations are building up domestic computing capacity through various models.\",\n",
       "    \"Some are procuring and operating sovereign AI clouds in collaboration with state-owned telecommunication providers or utilities. Others are sponsoring local cloud partners to provide a shared AI computing platform for public and private sector use. For example, Japan plans to invest more than $740 million in key digital infrastructure providers, including KDDI, Sakura Internet, and SoftBank to build out the nation's sovereign AI infrastructure. France-based Scaleway, a subsidiary of the Iliad Group, is building Europe's most powerful cloud-native AI supercomputer.\",\n",

And in Singapore, the National Supercomputer Centre is getting upgraded with NVIDIA Hopper GPUs, while Singtel is building NVIDIA's accelerated AI factories across Southeast Asia. NVIDIA's ability to offer end-to-end compute to networking technologies, full-stack software, AI expertise, and rich ecosystem of partners and customers allows sovereign AI and regional cloud providers to jump-start their country's AI ambitions. From nothing the previous year, we believe sovereign AI revenue can approach the high single-digit billions this year.\",\n",
       "    \"The importance of AI has caught the attention of every nation. We ramped new products designed specifically for China that don't require export control license. Our Data Center revenue in China is down significantly from the level prior to the imposition of the new export control restrictions in October. We expect the market in China to remain very competitive going forward.\",\n",
       "    \"From a product perspective, the vast majority of compute revenue was driven by our Hopper GPU architecture. Demand for Hopper during the quarter continues to increase. Thanks to CUDA algorithm innovations, we've been able to accelerate LLM inference on H100 by up to 3x, which can translate to a 3x cost reduction for serving popular models like Llama 3. We started sampling the H200 in Q1 and are currently in production with shipments on track for Q2.\",\n",
       "    'The first H200 system was delivered by Jensen to Sam Altman and the team at OpenAI and powered their amazing GPT-4o demos last week. H200 nearly doubles the inference performance of H100, delivering significant value for production deployments. For example, using Llama 3 with 700 billion parameters, a single NVIDIA HGX H200 server can deliver 24,000 tokens per second, supporting more than 2,400 users at the same time. That means for every $1 spent on NVIDIA HGX H200 servers at current prices per token, an API provider serving Llama 3 tokens can generate $7 in revenue over four years.',\n",
       "    'With ongoing software optimizations, we continue to improve the performance of NVIDIA AI infrastructure for serving AI models. While supply for H100 grew, we are still constrained on H200. At the same time, Blackwell is in full production. We are working to bring up our system and cloud partners for global availability later this year.',\n",
       "    'Demand for H200 and Blackwell is well ahead of supply, and we expect demand may exceed supply well into next year. Grace Hopper Superchip is shipping in volume. Last week at the International Supercomputing Conference, we announced that nine new supercomputers worldwide are using Grace Hopper for a combined 200 exaflops of energy-efficient AI processing power delivered this year.

We experienced a modest sequential decline, which was largely due to the timing of supply, with demand well ahead of what we were able to ship. We expect networking to return to sequential growth in Q2.',\n",
       "    'In the first quarter, we started shipping our new Spectrum-X Ethernet networking solution optimized for AI from the ground up. It includes our Spectrum-4 switch, BlueField-3 DPU, and new software technologies to overcome the challenges of AI on Ethernet to deliver 1.6x higher networking performance for AI processing compared with traditional Ethernet. Spectrum-X is ramping in volume with multiple customers, including a massive 100,000 GPU cluster. Spectrum-X opens a brand-new market to NVIDIA networking and enables Ethernet-only data centers to accommodate large-scale AI.',\n",
       "    'We expect Spectrum-X to jump to a multibillion-dollar product line within a year. At GTC in March, we launched our next-generation AI factory platform, Blackwell. The Blackwell GPU architecture delivers up to 4x faster training and 30x faster inference than the H100 and enables real-time generative AI on trillion-parameter large language models.

       "    \"Thanks a lot. I wanted to ask, Jensen, about the deployment of Blackwell versus Hopper just given the system's nature and all the demand for GB that you have. How does the deployment of this stuff differ from Hopper? I guess I ask because liquid cooling at scale hasn't been done before, and there's some engineering challenges both at the node level and within the data center. So, do these complexities sort of elongate the transition? And how do you sort of think about how that's all going? Thanks.\",\n",
       "    'And so, for some customers, they will ramp into their existing installed base of data centers that are already shipping Hoppers. They will easily transition from H100 to H200 to B100. And so, Blackwell systems have been designed to be backwards compatible, if you will, electrically, mechanically. And of course, the software stack that runs on Hopper will run fantastically on Blackwell.',\n",
       "    \"We also have been priming the pump, if you will, with the entire ecosystem, getting them ready for liquid cooling. We've been talking to the ecosystem about Blackwell for quite some time. And the CSPs, the data centers, the ODMs, the system makers, our supply chain; beyond them, the cooling supply chain base, liquid cooling supply chain base, data center supply chain base, no one is going to be surprised with Blackwell coming and the capabilities that we would like to deliver with Grace Blackwell 200. GB200 is going to be exceptional.\",\n",
       "    'Our next question will come from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America Securities. Please go ahead.',\n",
       "    \"Thanks for taking my question. Jensen, how are you ensuring that there is enough utilization of your products and that there isn't a pull ahead or a holding behavior because of tight supply, competition, or other factors? Basically, what checks have you built in the system to give us confidence that monetization is keeping pace with your really very strong shipment growth?\",\n",
       "    \"Well, I guess there's the big picture view that I'll come to, but I'll answer your question directly. The demand for GPUs in all the data centers is incredible. We're racing every single day. And the reason for that is because applications like ChatGPT and GPT-4o, and now, it's going to be multi-modality, Gemini and its ramp and Anthropic, and all of the work that's being done at all the CSPs are consuming every GPU that's out there.\",\n",
       "    \"There's also a long line of generative AI start-ups, some 15,000, 20,000 start-ups that are in all different fields, from multimedia to digital characters, of course, all kinds of design tool application, productivity applications, digital biology, the moving of the AV industry to video so that they can train end-to-end models to expand the operating domain of self-driving cars, the list is just quite extraordinary. We're racing actually. Customers are putting a lot of pressure on us to deliver the systems and stand those up as quickly as possible. And of course, I haven't even mentioned all of the sovereign AIs who would like to train all of their regional natural resource of their country, which is their data, to train their regional models.\",\n",
       "    \"And there's a lot of pressure to stand those systems up. So, anyhow, the demand, I think, is really, really high and it outstrips our supply. That's the reason why I jumped in to make a few comments. Longer term, we're completely redesigning how computers work.\",\n",
       "    \"And this is a platform shift. Of course, it's been compared to other platform shifts in the past. But time will clearly tell that this is much, much more profound than previous platform shifts. And the reason for that is because the computer is no longer an instruction-driven-only computer.\",\n",
       "    \"It's an intention-understanding computer. And it understands, of course, the way we interact with it, but it also understands our meaning, what we intend that we asked it to do. And it has the ability to reason, inference iteratively to process a plan, and come back with a solution. And so, every aspect of the computer is changing in such a way that instead of retrieving prerecorded files, it is now generating contextually relevant intelligent answers.\",\n",
       "    'Our next question will come from the line of Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.',\n",
       "    \"Great. Thank you. Understanding what you just said about how strong demand is, you have a lot of demand for H200 and for Blackwell products. Do you anticipate any kind of pause with Hopper and H100 as you sort of migrate to those products? Will people wait for those new products, which would be a good product to have? Or do you think there's enough demand for H100 to sustain growth?\",\n",
       "    \"We see increasing demand of Hopper through this quarter. And we expect demand to outstrip supply for some time as we now transition to H200, as we transition to Blackwell. Everybody is anxious to get their infrastructure online. And the reason for that is because they're saving money and making money, and they would like to do that as soon as possible.\",\n",
       "    'Our next question will come from the line of Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.',\n",
       "    \"Hi. Thank you so much for taking the question. Jensen, I wanted to ask about competition. I think many of your cloud customers have announced new or updates to their existing internal programs, right, in parallel to what they're working on with you guys.\",\n",
       "    \"To what extent did you consider them as competitors, medium to long term? And in your view, do you think they're limited to addressing mostly internal workloads, or could they be broader in what they address going forward? Thank you.\",\n",
       "    \"Yeah. We're different in several ways. First, NVIDIA's accelerated computing architecture allows customers to process every aspect of their pipeline from unstructured data processing to prepare it for training, to structured data processing, data frame processing like SQL to prepare for training, to training to inference. And as I was mentioning in my remarks, that inference has really fundamentally changed, it's now generation.\",\n",
       "    \"It's not trying to just detect the cat, which was plenty hard in itself, but it has to generate every pixel of a cat. And so, the generation process is a fundamentally different processing architecture. And it's one of the reasons why TensorRT-LLM was so well received. We improved the performance in using the same chips on our architecture by a factor of three.\",\n",
       "    \"That kind of tells you something about the richness of our architecture and the richness of our software. So, one, you could use NVIDIA for everything, from computer vision to image processing, to computer graphics, to all modalities of computing. And as the world is now suffering from computing cost and computing energy inflation because general-purpose computing has run its course, accelerated computing is really the sustainable way of going forward. So, accelerated computing is how you're going to save money in computing, is how you're going to save energy in computing.\",\n",
       "    \"And so, the versatility of our platform results in the lowest TCO for their data centers. Second, we're in every cloud. And so, for developers that are looking for a platform to develop on, starting with NVIDIA is always a great choice. And we're on-prem.\",\n",
       "    \"We're in the cloud. We're in computers of any size and shape. We're practically everywhere. And so, that's the second reason.\",\n",
       "    \"The third reason has to do with the fact that we build AI factories. And this is becoming more apparent to people that AI is not a chip problem only. It starts, of course, with very good chips and we build a whole bunch of chips for our AI factories, but it's a systems problem. In fact, even AI is now a systems problem.\",\n",
       "    \"It's not just one large language model. It's a complex system of a whole bunch of large language models that are working together. And so, the fact that NVIDIA builds this system causes us to optimize all of our chips to work together as a system, to be able to have software that operates as a system, and to be able to optimize across the system. And just to put it in perspective, in simple numbers, if you had a $5 billion infrastructure and you improved the performance by a factor of two, which we routinely do, when you improve the infrastructure by a factor of two, the value to you is $5 billion.\",\n",
       "    \"All the chips in that data center doesn't pay for it. And so, the value of it is really quite extraordinary. And this is the reason why today, performance matters in everything. This is at a time when the highest performance is also the lowest cost because the infrastructure cost of carrying all of these chips cost a lot of money.\",\n",
       "    'And it takes a lot of money to fund the data center, to operate the data center, the people that goes along with it, the power that goes along with it, the real estate that goes along with it, and all of it adds up. And so, the highest performance is also the lowest TCO.',\n",
       "    'Our next question will come from the line of Matt Ramsay with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.',\n",
       "    \"Thank you very much. Good afternoon, everyone. Jensen, I've been in the data center industry my whole career. I've never seen the velocity that you guys are introducing new platforms at the same combination of the performance jumps that you're getting, I mean, 5x in training, some of the stuff you talked about at GTC up to 30x in inference.\",\n",
       "    \"And it's an amazing thing to watch but it also creates an interesting juxtaposition where the current generation of product that your customers are spending billions of dollars on is going to be not as competitive with your new stuff very, very much more quickly than the depreciation cycle of that product. So, I'd like you to, if you wouldn't mind, speak a little bit about how you're seeing that situation evolve itself with customers. As you move to Blackwell, they're going to have very large installed bases, obviously software compatible, but large installed bases of product that's not nearly as performant as your new generation stuff. And it'd be interesting to hear what you see happening with customers along that path.\",\n",
       "    'Thank you.',\n",
       "    \"Yeah, really appreciate it. Three points that I'd like to make. If you're 5% into the build-out versus if you're 95% into the build-out, you're going to feel very differently. And because you're only 5% into the build-out anyhow, you build as fast as you can.\",\n",
       "    \"So, that's the smart thing to do. They need to make money today. They want to save money today. And time is really, really valuable to them.\",\n",
       "    \"Let me give you an example of time being really valuable, why this idea of standing up a data center instantaneously is so valuable, and getting this thing called time-to-train is so valuable. The reason for that is because the next company who reaches the next major plateau gets to announce a groundbreaking AI. And the second one after that gets to announce something that's 0.3% better. And so, the question is, do you want to be repeatedly the company delivering groundbreaking AI or the company delivering 0.3% better? And that's the reason why this race, as in all technology races, the race is so important.\",\n",
       "    \"And you're seeing this race across multiple companies because this is so vital to have technology leadership, for companies to trust the leadership that want to build on your platform and know that the platform that they're building on is going to get better and better. And so, leadership matters a great deal. Time-to-train matters a great deal. The difference between time-to-train that is three months earlier just to get it done, in order to get time-to-train on three months' project, getting started three months earlier is everything.\",\n",
       "    \"And so, it's the reason why we're standing up Hopper systems like mad right now because the next plateau is just around the corner. And so, that's the second reason. The first comment that you made is really a great comment, which is how is it that we're moving so fast and advancing them quickly, because we have all the stacks here. We literally build the entire data center, and we can monitor everything, measure everything, optimize across everything.\",\n",
       "    \"And the reason why we know they perform at scale is because we built it all here. Now, one of the things that we do that's a bit of a miracle is that we build entire AI infrastructure here but then we disaggregate it and integrate it into our customers' data centers however they liked. But we know how it's going to perform, and we know where the bottlenecks are. We know where we need to optimize with them, and we know where we have to help them improve their infrastructure to achieve the most performance.\",\n",
       "    \"This deep intimate knowledge at the entire data center scale is fundamentally what sets us apart today. We build every single chip from the ground up. We know exactly how processing is done across the entire system. And so, we understand exactly how it's going to perform and how to get the most out of it with every single generation.\",\n",
       "    'So, I appreciate it. Those are the three points.',\n",
       "    'Your next question will come from the line of Mark Lipacis with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.',\n",
       "    \"Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Jensen, in the past, you've made the observation that general-purpose computing ecosystems typically dominated each computing era. And I believe the argument was that they could adapt to different workloads, get higher utilization, drive cost of compute cycle down.\",\n",
       "    'And this is a motivation for why you were driving to a general-purpose GPU CUDA ecosystem for accelerated computing. And if I mischaracterized that observation, please do let me know. So, the question is, given that the workloads that are driving demand for your solutions are being driven by neural network training and inferencing, which on the surface seem like a limited number of workloads, then it might also seem to lend themselves to custom solutions. And so, then the question is, does the general-purpose computing framework become more at risk or is there enough variability or a rapid enough evolution on these workloads that support that historical general-purpose framework? Thank you.',\n",
       "    \"Yeah. NVIDIA's accelerated computing is versatile, but I wouldn't call it general purpose. Like, for example, we wouldn't be very good at running the spreadsheet. That was really designed for general-purpose computing.\",\n",
       "    \"And so, the control loop of an operating system code probably isn't fantastic for general-purpose computing, not for accelerated computing. And so, I would say that we're versatile, and that's usually the way I describe it. There's a rich domain of applications that we're able to accelerate over the years, but they all have a lot of commonalities, maybe some deep differences, but commonalities. They're all things that I can run in parallel, they're all heavily threaded.\",\n",
       "    '5% of the code represents 99% of the run time, for example. Those are all properties of accelerated computing. The versatility of our platform and the fact that we design entire systems is the reason why over the course of the last 10 years or so, the number of start-ups that you guys have asked me about in these conference calls is fairly large. And every single one of them, because of the brittleness of their architecture, the moment generative AI came along or the moment the fusion models came along, the moment the next models are coming along now, and now all of a sudden, look at this, large language models with memory because the large language model needs to have memory so they can carry on a conversation with you, understand the context.',\n",
       "    \"All of a sudden, the versatility of the Grace memory became super important. And so, each one of these advances in generative AI and the advancement of AI really begs for not having a widget that's designed for one model but to have something that is really good for this entire domain, properties of this entire domain, but obeys the first principles of software: that software is going to continue to evolve, that software is going to keep getting better and bigger. We believe in the scaling of these models. There's a lot of reasons why we're going to scale by easily 1 million times in the coming few years for good reasons, and we're looking forward to it, and we're ready for it.\",\n",
       "    \"And so, the versatility of our platform is really quite key. And if you're too brittle and too specific, you might as well just build an FPGA or you build an ASIC or something like that, but that's hardly a computer.\",\n",
       "    'Our next question will come from the line of Blayne Curtis with Jefferies. Please go ahead.',\n",

       "    \"H20 and how you're thinking about allocating supply between the different Hopper products.\",\n",
       "    \"Well, you know, we have customers that we honor and we do our best for every customer. It is the case that our business in China is substantially lower than the levels of the past. And it's a lot more competitive in China now because of the limitations on our technology. And so, those matters are true.\",\n",
       "    \"However, we continue to do our best to serve the customers in the markets there, and to the best of our ability, we'll do our best. But I think overall, the comments that we made about demand outstripping supply is for the entire market and particularly so for H200 and Blackwell toward the end of the year.\",\n",
       "    'Our next question will come from the line of Srini Pajjuri with Raymond James. Please go ahead.',\n",
       "    \"Thank you. Jensen, actually more of a clarification on what you said. GB200 systems, it looks like there is a significant demand for systems. Historically, I think you've sold a lot of HGX boards and some GPUs and the systems business was relatively small.\",\n",
       "    \"So, I'm just curious, why is it that now you are seeing such a strong demand for systems going forward? Is it just the TCO, or is it something else? Or is it just the architecture? Thank you.\",\n",
       "    'Yeah. I appreciate that. In fact, the way we sell GB200 is the same. We disaggregate all of the components that make sense, and we integrate it into computer makers.',\n",
       "    \"We have 100 different computer system configurations that are coming this year for Blackwell. And that is off the charts. Hopper, frankly, had only half, but that's at its peak. It started out with way less than that even.\",\n",
       "    \"And so, you're going to see liquid-cooled version, air-cooled version, x86 versions, Grace versions, so on and so forth. There's a whole bunch of systems that are being designed. And they're offered from all of our ecosystem of great partners. Nothing has really changed.\",\n",
       "    \"Now, of course, the Blackwell platform has expanded our offering tremendously, the integration of CPUs, and the much more compressed density of computing. Liquid cooling is going to save data centers a lot of money in provisioning power and not to mention to be more energy efficient. And so, it's a much better solution. It's more expansive, meaning that we offer a lot more components of a data center.\",\n",
       "    'We have a lot more to offer our customers this generation around.',\n",
       "    'Our next question will come from the line William Stein with Truist Securities. Please go ahead.',\n",
       "    \"Great. Thanks for taking my question. Jensen, at some point, NVIDIA decided that while there were reasonably good CPUs available for data center operations, your ARM-based Grace CPU provides some real advantage that made that technology worth to bring to customers, perhaps related to cost or power consumption or technical synergies between Grace and Hopper or Grace and Blackwell. Can you address whether there could be a similar dynamic that might emerge on the client side whereby, while there are very good solutions, you've highlighted that Intel and AMD are very good partners and deliver great products in x86, but there might be some, especially in emerging AI workloads, advantage that NVIDIA can deliver that others have more of a challenge?\",\n",
       "    \"Well, you mentioned some really good reasons. It is true that for many of the applications, our partnership with x86 partners are really terrific and we build excellent systems together. But Grace allows us to do something that isn't possible with the configuration, the system configuration today. The memory system between Grace and Hopper are coherent and connected.\",\n",
       "    \"It's the first data center-grade low-power memory. And so, we save a lot of power on every single node. And then finally, because of the architecture, because we can create our own architecture with the entire system now, we could create something that has a really large NVLink domain, which is vitally important to the next-generation large language models for inferencing. And so, you saw that GB200 has a 72-node NVLink domain.\",\n",
       "    \"That's like 72 Blackwells connected together into one giant GPU. And so, we needed Grace Blackwells to be able to do that. And so, there are architectural reasons, there are software programming reasons and then there are system reasons that are essential for us to build them that way. And so, if we see opportunities like that, we'll explore it.\",\n",
       "    \"And today, as you saw at the build yesterday, which I thought was really excellent, Satya announced the next-generation PCs, Copilot+ PC, which runs fantastically on NVIDIA's RTX GPUs that are shipping in laptops. But it also supports ARM beautifully. And so, it opens up opportunities for system innovation even for PCs.\",\n",

       "    \"Yeah, good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. I guess, Jensen, a bit of a longer-term question. I know Blackwell hasn't even launched yet, but obviously, investors are forward-looking.\",\n",
       "    \"And amid rising potential competition from GPUs and custom ASICs, how are you thinking about NVIDIA's pace of innovation? And your million-fold scaling over the last decade, truly impressive, CUDA, precision, Grace, Cohere, and connectivity. When you look forward, what frictions need to be solved in the coming decade? And I guess maybe more importantly, what are you willing to share with us today?\",\n",
       "    \"Well, I can announce that after Blackwell, there's another chip. And we are on a one-year rhythm. And you can also count on us having new networking technology on a very fast rhythm. We're announcing Spectrum-X for Ethernet.\",\n",
       "    \"But we're all in on Ethernet, and we have a really exciting road map coming for Ethernet. We have a rich ecosystem of partners. Dell announced that they're taking Spectrum-X to market. We have a rich ecosystem of customers and partners who are going to announce taking our entire AI factory architecture to market.\",\n",
       "    \"And so, for companies that want the ultimate performance, we have InfiniBand computing fabric. InfiniBand is a computing fabric, Ethernet to network. And InfiniBand, over the years, started out as a computing fabric, became a better and better network. Ethernet is a network and with Spectrum-X, we're going to make it a much better computing fabric.\",\n",
       "    \"And we're committed, fully committed, to all three links, NVLink computing fabric for single computing domain, to InfiniBand computing fabric, to Ethernet networking computing fabric. And so, we're going to take all three of them forward at a very fast clip. And so, you're going to see new switches coming, new NICs coming, new capability, new software stacks that run on all three of them. New CPUs, new GPUs, new networking NICs, new switches, a mound of chips that are coming.\",\n",
       "    \"And so, I think the pace of innovation that we're bringing will drive up the capability, on the one hand, and drive down the TCO on the other hand.

Where do you think we are in the adoption curve in terms of your shipments into the generative AI market?

We had seen historically over the last several quarters that China and some of the other impacted destinations to be about 20% to 25% of our data center revenue. We are expecting in our guidance for that to decrease substantially as we move into Q4. The export controls will have a negative effect on our China business, and we do not have good visibility into the magnitude of that impact even over the long term.',\n",
       "    \"We are, though, working to expand our data center product portfolio to possibly offer new regulation compliance solutions that do not require a license.

       "    \"Generative AI is the largest TAM expansion of software and hardware that we've seen in several decades. At the core of it, what's really exciting is that what was largely a retrieval-based computing approach, almost everything that you do as we treated off of storage somewhere. As has been augmented now add it with a generative method, and it's changed almost everything. You could see that text to text, text to image, text to video, text to 3D, text to protein, text to chemicals.\",\n",
       "    \"These are things that were processed and typed by humans in the past, and these are now generative approaches. The way that we access data has changed. It used to be based on explicit queries, it is now based on natural language queries, intention queries, semantic queries. And so, we're excited about the work that we're doing with SAP and Dropbox and many others that you're going to hear about.\",\n",
       "    \"And so, the transformation of software and the way that software is done is driving the hardware underneath. And you can see that it's transforming in two ways. One is something that's largely independent of generative AI. There's two trends.\",\n",
       "    'One is related to accelerated computing. General-purpose computing is too wasteful of energy and cost. And now that we have a much, much better approaches called accelerated computing, you could save an order of magnitude of energy, you could save an order of magnitude of time where you can save an order of magnitude of cost by using acceleration. And so, accelerated computing is transitioning, if you will, general-purpose computing into this new approach.',\n",
       "    \"And that has been augmented by a new class of data centers. This is the traditional data centers that you were just talking about, where we represent about a third of that. But there's a new class of data centers. And this new class of data centers, unlike the data centers of the past where you have a lot of applications running used by a great many people that are different tenants that are using the same infrastructure, and the data center stores a lot of files.\",\n",
       "    'These new data essentials are very few applications if not one application used by basically one tenant. And it processes data. It trains models and it generates tokens, it generates AI. And we call these new data center AI factories.',\n",
       "    \"We're seeing AI factories being built out everywhere in just about every country. And so, if you look at the way where we are in the expansion, the transition into this new computing approach, the first wave you saw with large language model start-ups, generative AI start-ups, and consumer Internet companies. And we're in the process of ramping that. Meanwhile, that's being ramped.\",\n",

       "    \"Yeah. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask about kind of the networking side of the business. Given the growth rates that you've now cited.\",\n",
       "    \"Yeah. Thanks for the question. Our networking business is already at a $10 billion-plus run rate. And it's going to get much larger.\",\n",
       "    'And as you mentioned, we added a new networking platform to our networking business recently. The vast majority of the dedicated large-scale AI factories standardized on InfiniBand. And the reason for that is really because of its data rate and not only just the latency but the way that it moves traffic around the network is really important. The way that you process AI and a multi-tenant hyperscale Ethernet environment, the traffic pattern is just radically different.',\n",
       "    \"We do floating point calculations and computation right on the switch and right in the fabric itself. And so, that's the reason why that difference in Ethernet versus InfiniBand where InfiniBand versus Ethernet for AI factories is so dramatic. And the difference is profound and the reason for that is because you've just invested in a $2 billion infrastructure for AI factories, a 20%, 25%, 30% difference in overall effectiveness, especially as you scale up is measured in hundreds of millions of dollars of value. And if you were renting that infrastructure over the course of four or five years, it really adds up.\",\n",
       "    \"And so, InfiniBand's value proposition is undeniable for AI factories. However, as we move AI into enterprise, this is enterprise computing where we'd like to enable every company to be able to build their own custom AI. We're building customer AIs in our company based on our proprietary data, our proprietary type of skills. For example, recently, we spoke about one of the models that we're creating.\",\n",
       "    \"And so, we would like the AI to be able to run an Ethernet environment. And so, what we've done is we invented this new platform that extends Ethernet. It doesn't replace the Ethernet, it's 100% compliant with Ethernet, and it's optimized for east-west traffic, which is where the computing fabric is. It adds to Ethernet with an end-to-end solution with Bluefield as well as our Spectrum switch that allows us to perform some of the capabilities that we have in InfiniBand, not all but some, and we achieved excellent results.\",\n",

The capability of Grace Hopper is really quite spectacular. It has the ability to create compute nodes that simultaneously have very fast memory as well as very large memory.',\n",
       "    'In the areas of vector databases or semantic search, what is called REG, retrieval augmented generation, so that you could have a generative AI model, be able to refer to proprietary data or factful data before it generates a response. That data is quite large. And you could also have applications or generative models where the context length is very high. You basically store an entire book into its system memory before you ask a question.',\n",
       "    \"And so, the context link can be quite large. This way, the degenerative models have the ability to still be able to naturally interact with you on one hand, on the other hand, be able to refer to factual data, proprietary data or domain-specific data, newer data, and be continually relevant and reduce hallucination. And so, that particular use case, for example, is really quite fantastic for Grace Hopper. It also serves the customers that really care to have a different CPU the X86, maybe it's European supercomputing centers or European companies who would like to build up their own ARM ecosystem and I'd like to build up a stack or CSPs that have decided that they would like to pivot ARM because their own custom CPUs are based on ARM.\",\n",

       "    'But with the absence of China, for our outlook for Q4, sure, there could have been some things that we are not supply constrained that we could have sold to China, but we no longer can. So, could our guidance have been a little higher in our Q4? Yes. We are still working on improving our supply and plan on continuing and growing all throughout next year as well toward that.',\n",
       "    'Your next question comes from the line of Matt Ramsay of TD Cowen. Your line is open.',\n",
       "    \"Thank you very much. Congrats everybody on the results. Jen-Hsun, I had a two-part question for you, and it comes off of sort of one premise. And the premise is I still get a lot of questions from investors thinking about AI training as being NVIDIA's dominant domain and that somehow as inference, even large model inference takes more and more of the TAM that the market will become more competitive, you'll be less differentiated, etc., etc.\",\n",
       "    \"So, I guess the two parts of the question are, number one, maybe you could spend a little bit of time talking about the evolution of the inference workload as we move to LLM and how your company is positioned for that rather than smaller model inference. And second, up until a month or two ago, I never really got any questions at all about the data processing piece of the AI workload. So, the pieces of manipulating the data before training, between training and inference, after inference. And I think that's a large part of the workload now.\",\n",
       "    'Maybe you could talk about how CUDA is enabling acceleration of those pieces of the workload. Thanks.',\n",
       "    \"Sure. Inference, inference is complicated. It's actually incredibly complicated. If you – we, this quarter, announced one of the most exciting new engines optimizing compilers called TensorRT LM.\",\n",
       "    \"The reception has been incredible. You go to GitHub. It's been downloaded a ton, a whole lot of stars integrated into stacks and frameworks all over the world, almost instantaneously. And there are several reasons for that, obviously.\",\n",
       "    \"We could create TensorRT LLM because CUDA's programmable. If CUDA and our GPUs were not so programmable, it would really be hard for us to improve software stacks at the pace that we do. TensorRT LLM on the same GPU without anybody touching anything, improves the performance by a factor of two. And then on top of that, of course, the pace of our innovation is so high.\",\n",
       "    \"H200 increases it by another factor of two. And so, our inference performance another way of saying inference cost just reduced by a factor of four within about a year's time. And so, that's really, really hard to keep up with. Now, the reason why everybody likes our inference engine is because our installed base.\",\n",
       "    \"And we've been dedicated to our installed base for 20 years, 20-plus years. We have an installed base that is not only largest in every single cloud, it's in every available from every enterprise system maker. It's used by companies of just about every industry. And any time you see an NVIDIA GPU, it runs our stack.\",\n",
       "    \"It's architecturally compatible. It's something we've been dedicated to for a very long time. We're very disciplined about it. We make it, if you will, architecture compatibility is job one.\",\n",
       "    \"Data processing, before you could train a model, you have to augment the data. You have to debug the data, maybe you have to augment the data with synthetic data. So, you process that they clean the data, align the data, normalize the data, all of that data is measured not in bites and megabytes. It's measured in terabytes and petabytes.\",\n",
       "    \"We accelerate Spark. We accelerate Python. One of the coolest things that we just did, it's called cuDF Pandas. Without one line of code, Pandas, which is the single most successful data science framework in the world, Pandas now is accelerated by NVIDIA CUDA and just out of the box without the line of code.\",\n",
       "    'And so, the acceleration is really quite terrific. And people are just incredibly excited about. And Pandas was designed for one purpose and one purpose only really data processing for data science. And so, NVIDIA CUDA gives you all of that.',\n",
       "    'Your final question comes from the line of Harlan Sur of JPMorgan. Your line is open.',\n",
       "    'Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. If you look at the history of the tech industry, right, those companies that have been successful have always been focused on ecosystem silicon, hardware, software, strong partnerships, and just as importantly, right, an aggressive cadence of new products, more segmentation over time. The team recently announced a more aggressive new product cadence and data center from two years and now every year with higher levels of segmentation, training, optimization, inferencing, CPU, GDP, GPU networking.',\n",
       "    'How do we think about your R&D opex growth to support a more aggressive and expanding for road map? But more importantly, what is the team doing to manage and drive execution through all of this complexity?',\n",
       "    \"Gosh, you know, boy, that's just really excellent. You just wrote NVIDIA's business plan. And you described our strategy. First of all, there is a fundamental reason why we accelerate our execution.\",\n",
       "    \"And the reason for that is because it fundamentally drives down cost. When the combination of TensorRT LLM and 200 reduced the cost for our customers for large model inference by a factor of four. And so, that includes, of course, our speeds and feeds, but mostly it's because of our software, mostly the software benefits because of the architecture. And so, we want to accelerate our road map for that reason.\",\n",
       "    \"The second reason is to expand the reach of generative AI. The world's number of data center configurations, this is kind of the amazing thing. NVIDIA is in every cloud, but not one cloud is the same. NVIDIA is working with every single cloud service provider and not one of their networking control plane security posture is the same.\",\n",
       "    \"Everybody's platform is different. And yet we're integrated into all of their stacks, all of their data centers, and we work incredibly well with all of them. And not to mention, we didn't take the whole thing, and we create AI factories that are stand-alone. We take our platform.\",\n",
       "    \"We can put them into supercomputers. We can put them into enterprise. Bringing AI to enterprise is something generative AI to enterprise something nobody has ever done before. And we're right now in the process of going to market with all of that.\",\n",
       "    \"There's market demand in manufacturing, there's market demand, and of course, in AI, in financial services and supercomputing, and quantum computing. The list of markets and segments that we have domain-specific libraries is incredibly broad. And then finally, now we have an end-to-end solution for data centers. InfiniBand network, InfiniBand networking, Ethernet networking, x86 ARM, just about every permutation combination of solutions, technology solutions, and software stacks provided.\",\n",
       "    \"When we optimize TensorRT for the cloud, we optimize it for enterprise. When we do something that brings in a new feature, a new library, a new feature, or a new developer, they instantly get the benefit of all of our reach. And so, that discipline, that architecture-compatible discipline that has lasted more than a couple of decades now is one of the reasons why NVIDIA is still really, really efficient. I mean, we're 28,000 people large and serving just about every single company, every single industry, every single market around the world.\",\n",

       "    'Thanks, Simona. Q1 revenue was 7.19 billion, up 19% sequentially and down 13% year on year. Strong sequential growth was driven by record data center revenue with our gaming and professional visualization platforms emerging from channel inventory corrections. Starting with data center.',\n",
       "    'Record revenue of 4.28 billion was up 18% sequentially and up 14% year on year on strong growth of our accelerated computing platform worldwide. Generative AI is driving exponential growth in compute requirements and a fast transition to NVIDIA accelerated computing, which is the most versatile, most energy-efficient, and the lowest TCO approach to train and deploy AI. Generative AI drove significant upside in demand for our products, creating opportunities and broad-based global growth across our markets. Let me give you some color across our three major customer categories: Cloud service providers or CSPs, consumer internet companies, and enterprises.',\n",
       "    'First, CSPs around the world are racing to deploy our flagship Hopper and Ampere architecture GPUs to meet the surge in interest from both enterprise and consumer, AI applications for training, and inference. Multiple CSPs announced the availability of H100 on their platforms, including private previews at Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, upcoming offerings at AWS and general availability at emerging GPU specialized cloud providers like CoreWeave and Lambda. In addition to enterprise AI adoption, these CSPs are serving strong demand for H100 from generative AI pioneers. Second, consumer internet companies are also at the forefront of adopting generative AI and deep learning-based recommendation systems, driving strong growth.',\n",
       "    \"For example, Meta has now deployed its H100-powered brand Teton AI supercomputer for its AI production and research teams. Third, enterprise demand for AI and accelerated computing is strong. We are seeing momentum in verticals such as automotive, financial services, healthcare, and telecom where AI and accelerated computing are quickly becoming integral to customers' innovation road maps and competitive positioning. For example, Bloomberg announced it has a $50 billion parameter model, BloombergGPT, to help with financial natural language processing tasks such as sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, news classification, and question answering.\",\n",
       "    'Auto insurance company, CCC Intelligence Solutions, is using AI for estimating repairs. And AT&T is working with us on AI to improve fleet dispatches so their field technicians can better serve customers. Among other enterprise customers using NVIDIA AI are Deloitte, for logistics and customer service, and Amgen, for drug discovery and protein engineering. This quarter, we started shipping DGX H100, our Hopper generation AI system, which customers can deploy on-prem.',\n",
       "    'They include NVIDIA NeMo for large language models; NVIDIA Picasso for images, video, and 3D; and NVIDIA BioNeMo for life sciences. Each service has six elements: pretrained models, frameworks for data processing and curation, proprietary knowledge-based vector databases, systems for fine-tuning, aligning and guardrailing, optimized inference engines, and support from NVIDIA experts to help enterprises fine-tune models for their custom use cases. ServiceNow, a leading enterprise services platform is an early adopter of DGX Cloud and NeMo. They are developing custom large language models trained on data specifically for the ServiceNow platform.',\n",
       "    \"Our collaboration will let ServiceNow create new enterprise-grade generative AI offerings with the thousands of enterprises worldwide running on the ServiceNow platform, including for IT departments, customer service teams, employees, and developers. Generative AI is also driving a step function increase in inference workflows. Because of their size and complexities, these workflows require acceleration. The latest MLPerf industry benchmark released in April showed NVIDIA's inference platforms deliver performance that is orders of magnitude ahead of the industry with unmatched versatility across diverse workloads.\",\n",
       "    \"To help customers deploy generative AI applications at scale, at GTC, we announced four major new inference platforms that leverage the NVIDIA AI software stack. These include L4 Tensor Core GPU for AI video; L40 for Omniverse and graphics rendering, H100 NBL for large language models; and the Grace Hopper Superchip for LLM and also recommendation systems and vector databases. Google Cloud is the first CSP to adopt our L4 inference platform with the launch of its G2 virtual machines for generative AI inference and other workloads, such as Google Cloud Dataproc, Google [Inaudible], Google Alpha Fold and Google Cloud's Immersive Stream, which render 3D and AR experiences. In addition, Google is integrating our Triton Inference Server with Google Kubernetes engine and its cloud-based Vertex AI platform.\",\n",
       "    \"In networking, we saw strong demand at both CSPs and enterprise customers for generative AI and accelerated computing, which require high-performance networking like NVIDIA's Mellanox networking platforms. Demand relating to general purpose CPU infrastructure remains soft. As generative AI applications grow in size and complexity, high-performance networks become essential for delivering accelerated computing at data center scale to meet the enormous demand of both training and inferencing. Our 400-gig Quantum-2 InfiniBand platform is the gold standard for AI-dedicated infrastructure, with broad adoption across major cloud and consumer internet platforms, such as Microsoft Azure.\",\n",
       "    \"With the combination of in-network computing technology and the industry's only end-to-end data center scale optimized software stack, customers routinely enjoy a 20% increase in throughput for their sizable infrastructure investment. For multi-tenant cloud transitioning to support generative AI, our high-speed ethernet platform with BlueField-3 DPUs and Spectrum-4 ethernet switching offers the highest available ethernet network performance. BlueField-3 is in production and has been adopted by multiple hyperscale and CSP customers, including Microsoft Azure, Oracle Cloud, CoreWeave, Baidu, and others. We look forward to sharing more about our 400-gig spectrum for accelerated AI networking platform next week at the COMPUTEX conference in Taiwan.\",\n",
       "    \"Lastly, our Grace data center CPU is sampling with customers. At this week's International Supercomputing Conference in Germany, the University of Bristol announced a new supercomputer based on the NVIDIA Grace CPU superchip, which is 6x more energy efficient than the previous supercomputer. This adds to growing momentum for Grace with both CPU-only and CPU-GPU opportunities across AI and cloud and supercomputing applications. The coming wave of BlueField-3, Grace, and Grace Hopper superchips will enable a new generation of super energy-efficient accelerated data centers.\",\n",
       "    \"Now, let's move to gaming. Gaming revenue of 2.24 billion was up 22% sequentially and down 38% year on year. Strong sequential growth was driven by sales of the 40 Series GeForce RTX GPUs for both notebooks and desktops. Overall, end demand was solid and consistent with seasonality, demonstrating resilience against a challenging consumer spending backdrop.\",\n",
       "    'The GeForce RTX 40 Series GPU laptops are off to a great start, featuring four NVIDIA inventions, RTX path tracing, DLSS 3 AI rendering, Reflex Ultra-low latency rendering, and Max-Q energy-efficient technologies. They deliver tremendous gains in industrial design, performance, and battery life for gamers and creators. Unlike our desktop offerings, 40 Series laptops support the NVIDIA Studio platform for software technologies, including acceleration for creative data science and AI workflows, and Omniverse, giving content creators unmatched tools and capabilities. In desktop, we ramped the RTX 4070, which joined the previously launched RTX 4090, 4080, and the 4070 TI GPUs.',\n",

These GPUs, for the first time, provide 2x the performance of the latest gaming console at mainstream price points. The 4060 TI is available starting today, while the 4060 will be available in July.\",\n",
       "    'Generative AI will be transformative to gaming and content creation from development to runtime. At the Microsoft Build Developer Conference earlier this week, we showcased how Windows PCs and workstations with NVIDIA RTX GPUs will be AI-powered at their core. NVIDIA and Microsoft have collaborated on end-to-end software engineering, spanning from the Windows operating system to the NVIDIA graphics drivers and NeMo LLM framework to help make Windows on NVIDIA RTX Tensor Core GPUs a supercharged platform for generative AI. Last quarter, we announced a partnership with Microsoft to bring Xbox PC games to GeForce NOW.',\n",

There are now over 1,600 games on GeForce NOW, the richest content available on any cloud gaming service. Moving to pro visualization. Revenue of 295 million was up 31% sequentially and down 53% year on year.',\n",
       "    'Sequential growth was driven by stronger workstation demand across both mobile and desktop form factors, with strength in key verticals such as public sector, healthcare, and automotive. We believe the channel inventory correction is behind us. The ramp of our Ada Lovelace GPU architecture in workstations kicks off a major product cycle. At GTC, we announced six new RTX GPUs for laptops and desktop workstations, with further rollouts planned in the coming quarters.',\n",
       "    'Generative AI is a major new workload for NVIDIA-powered workstation. Our collaboration with Microsoft transforms Windows into the ideal platform for creators and designers harnessing generative AI to elevate their creativity and productivity.

       "    'Moving to automotive. Revenue was 296 million, up 1% sequentially and up 114% from a year ago. Our strong year-on-year growth was driven by the ramp of the NVIDIA DRIVE Orin across a number of new energy vehicles. As we announced in March, our automotive design win pipeline over the next six years now is down at 14 billion, up from $11 billion a year ago, giving us visibility into continued growth over the coming years.',\n",

       "    'Hi. Good afternoon. Thank you so much for taking the question, and congrats on the strong results and incredible outlook. Just one question on data center.',\n",
       "    \"Colette, you mentioned the vast majority of the sequential increase in revenue this quarter will come from data center. I was curious what the construct is there, if you can speak to what the key drivers are from April to July. And perhaps more importantly, you talked about visibility into the second half of the year. I'm guessing it's more of a supply problem at this point.\",\n",
       "    'What kind of sequential growth beyond the July quarter can your supply chain support at this point? Thank you.',\n",
       "    \"OK. So, a lot of different questions there, so let me see if I can start, and I'm sure Jensen will have some following-up comments. So, when we talk about our sequential growth that were expected between Q1 and Q2, our generative AI, large language models are driving this surge in demand. And it's broad-based across both our consumer Internet companies, our CSPs, our enterprises, and our AI start-ups.\",\n",
       "    'It is also interest in both of our architectures, both of our Hopper latest architecture, as well as our Ampere architecture. This is not surprising as we generally often sell both of our architectures at the same time. This is also a key area where deep recommendators are driving growth. And we also expect to see growth both in our computing, as well as in our networking business.',\n",
       "    'So, those are some of the key things that we have baked in when we think about the guidance that we have provided to Q2. We also surfaced in our opening remarks that we are working on both supply today for this quarter, but we have also procured a substantial amount of supply for the second half. We have some significant supply chain flow to serve our significant customer demand that we see. And this is demand that we see across a wide range of different customers.',\n",
       "    \"They are building platforms for some of the largest enterprises but also setting things up at the CSPs and the large consumer internet companies. So, we have visibility right now for our data center demand that has probably extended out a few quarters. And this led us to working on quickly procuring that substantial supply for the second half. I'm going to pause there and see if Jensen wants to add a little bit more.\",\n",
       "    'I thought that was great, Colette. Thank you.',\n",
       "    \"Next, we'll go to C.J. Muse with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\",\n",
       "    'Yeah. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. You know, I guess with data center essentially doubling quarter on quarter, two natural kind of questions that relate to one another come to mind.',\n",
       "    'Number one, where are we in terms of driving acceleration into servers to support AI? And as part of that, as you deal with longer cycle times with TSMC and your other partners, how are you thinking about managing their commitments there with where you want to manage your lead times in the coming years to best kind of match that supply and demand? Thanks so much.',\n",
       "    \"NVIDIA's supply chain flow and our supply chain is very significant, as you know. And we build supercomputers in volume, and these are giant systems, and we build them in volume. It includes, of course, the GPUs. But on our GPUs, the system boards have 35,000 other components.\",\n",
       "    \"And the networking and the fiber optics and the incredible transceivers and the NICs, the SmartNICs, the switches, all of that has to come together in order for us to stand up a data center. And so, we were already in full production when that moment came. We had to really significantly increase our procurement substantially for the second half, as Colette said. Now, let me talk about the bigger picture and why the entire world's data centers are moving toward accelerated computing.\",\n",
       "    \"And what happened is when generative AI I came along, it triggered a killer app for this computing platform that's been in preparation for some time. And so, now, we see ourselves in two simultaneous transitions: the world's $1 trillion data center is nearly populated entirely by CPUs today. And $1 trillion is $250 billion a year. It's growing, of course.\",\n",
       "    \"OK. We'll move to our next question, Vivek Arya with BofA Securities. Your line is open.\",\n",
       "    'Yeah, Vivek. Thanks for the question. Let me see if I can add a little bit more color. We believe that the supply that we will have for the second half of the year will be substantially larger than H1.',\n",
       "    \"So, we are expecting, not only the demand that we just saw in this last quarter, the demand that we have in Q2 for our forecast, but also planning on seeing something in the second half of the year. We just have to be careful here, but we're not here to guide on the second half. But yes, we do plan a substantial increase in the second half compared to the first half.\",\n",
       "    \"Regarding competition, we have competition from every direction, start-ups, really, really well funded and innovative start-ups, countless of them all over the world. We have competitions from existing semiconductor companies. We have competition from CSPs with internal projects, and many of you know about most of these. And so, we're mindful of competition all the time, and we get competition all the time.\",\n",
       "    \"NVIDIA's value proposition at the core is we are the lowest cost solution. We're the lowest TCO solution. And the reason for that is because accelerated computing is two things that I talked about often, which is it's a full stack problem. It's a full stack challenge.\",\n",
       "    \"We have 400 acceleration libraries. As you know, the amount of libraries and frameworks that we accelerate is pretty mind-blowing. The second part is that generative AI is a large-scale problem and it's a data center scale problem. It's another way of thinking that the computer is the data center or the data center is the computer.\",\n",
       "    \"It's not the chip, it's the data center. And it's never happened like this before. And in this particular environment, your networking operating system, your distributed computing engines, your understanding of the architecture of the networking gear, the switches, and the computing systems, the computing fabric, that entire system is your computer. And that's what you're trying to operate.\",\n",
       "    \"And so, in order to get the best performance, you have to understand full stack and understand data center scale. And that's what accelerated computing is. The second thing is that utilization, which talks about the amount of the types of applications that you can accelerate and the versatility of your architecture keeps that utilization high. If you can do one thing and do one thing only incredibly fast, then your data center is largely underutilized, and it's hard to scale that out.\",\n",
       "    \"NVIDIA's universal GPU, the fact that we accelerate so many of these stacks, makes our utilization incredibly high. And so, number one is steer put, and that's software-intensive problems and data center architecture problem. The second is digitalization versatility problem. And the third, it's just data center expertise.\",\n",
       "    'And the expertise of the team in doing that is incredible. And so, our value proposition is in the final analysis. All of this technology translates into infrastructure, the highest throughput and the lowest possible cost. And so, I think our market is, of course, very, very competitive, very large, but the challenge is really, really great.',\n",
       "    'Next, we go to Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.',\n",
       "    \"I'll turn it over to Jensen if needs to comment.\",\n",
       "    'Yes. We can see in real time the growth of generative AI in CSPs, both for training the models, refining the models, as well as deploying the models. As Colette said earlier, inference is now a major driver of accelerated computing because generative AI is used so capably in so many applications already. There are two segments that require a new stack of software, and the two segments are enterprise and industrials.',\n",
       "    \"Obviously, in order to train an AI model, you have a lot of data you have to process and package up and curate and align. And there's just a whole bunch of stuff that you have to do to the data to prepare it for training. That amount of data could consume some 40%, 50%, 60% of your computing time. And so, data processing is a very big deal.\",\n",

You're never done producing and processing a vector database that augments the large language model. You're never done with vectorizing all of the collected structured, unstructured data that you have.\",\n",
       "    \"And in that particular case, it's largely dedicated to training and processing data and vectorizing data and learning representation of the data, so on and so forth. The inference part of it are APIs that are either open APIs that can be connected to all kinds of applications, APIs that are integrated into workflows but APIs of all kinds. There will be hundreds of APIs in a company. Some of them, they built themselves.\",\n",
       "    \"It's called generative AI. And so, the easiest way to think about that is your $1 trillion infrastructure. Every quarter's capital, capex budget would lean very heavily into generative AI, into accelerated computing infrastructure, everywhere from the number of GPUs that would be used in the capex budget to the accelerated switches and accelerated networking chips that connect them all. The easiest way to think about that is, over the next four, five, 10 years, most of that $1 trillion and then compensating, adjusting for all the growth in data center still, it will be largely generative AI.\",\n",

       "    \"I think your data center networking business is driving about $1 billion of revenues per quarter, plus or minus. That's 2.5x growth from three years ago, right, when you guys acquired Mellanox, so very strong growth. But given the very high attach of your InfiniBand ethernet solutions, your accelerated compute platforms, is the networking run rate stepping up in line with your compute shipments? And then, what is the team doing to further unlock more networking bandwidth going forward just to keep pace with the significant increase in compute complexity, data sets, requirements for lower latency, better traffic predictability and so on?\",\n",

And networking, remember, we announced very, very early on this networking stack called DOCA, and we have an acceleration library called Magnum IO. These two pieces of software are some of the crown jewels of our company. Nobody ever talks about it because it's hard to understand, but it makes it possible for us to connect tens of thousands of GPUs.\",\n",
       "    \"How do you connect tens of thousands of GPUs if the operating system of the data center, which is the infrastructure, is not insanely great? And so, that's the reason why we're so obsessed about networking in the company. And one of the great things that we have, we have Mellanox, as you know quite well, was the world's highest performance and the unambiguous leader in high-performance networking. It's the reason why our two companies are together. You also see that our network expands starting from NVLink, which is a computing fabric with really super low latency, and it communicates using memory references, not network packaged.\",\n",
       "    \"And then, we take NVLink. We connect it inside multiple GPUs, and I've described going beyond the GPU. And I'll talk a lot more about that at COMPUTEX in a few days.

       "    \"We sell it to all of the world's data centers as components so that they can integrate it into whatever style or architecture that they would like and we can still run our software stack. That's the reason why we break it up. It's way more complicated the way that we do it, but it makes it possible for NVIDIA's computing architecture to be integrated into anybody's data center in the world from cloud of all different kinds to on-prem of all different kinds, all the way out to the edge to 5G. And so, this way of doing it is really, really complicated, but it gives us incredible reach.\",\n",

Hyperscale customer revenue posted strong sequential growth, though short of our expectations as some cloud service providers paused at the end of the year to recalibrate their build plans. Though we generally see tightening that reflects overall macroeconomic uncertainty, we believe this is a timing issue as the end market demand for GPUs and AI infrastructure is strong.',\n",
       "    'Networking grew but a bit less than our expected on softer demand for general purpose CPU infrastructure. The total data center sequential revenue decline was driven by lower sales in China, which was largely in line with our expectations, reflecting COVID and other domestic issues. With cloud adoption continuing to grow, we are serving an expanding list of fast-growing cloud service providers, including Oracle and GPU specialized CSPs. Revenue growth from CSP customers last year significantly outpaced that of data center as a whole as more enterprise customers moved to a cloud-first approach.',\n",

In just the second quarter of its ramp, H100 revenue was already much higher than that of A100, which declined sequentially. This is a testament of the exceptional performance on the H100, which is as much as nine x faster than the A100 for training and up 30x cluster in inferencing of transformer-based large language models.',\n",

The computing intensity for generative AI, if it is very high, does it limit the market size to just a handful of hyperscalers? And on the other extreme, if the market gets very large, then doesn't it attract more competition for NVIDIA from cloud ASICs or other accelerator options that are out there in the market?\",\n",

Moore's Law, in its best days, would have delivered 100x in a decade. By coming up with new processors, new systems, new interconnects, new frameworks and algorithms, and working with data scientists, AI researchers on new models, across that entire span, we've made large language model processing a million times faster, a million times faster.\",\n",
       "    \"So that's one thought. The second is the number of large language models or foundation models that have to be developed is quite large. Different countries with different cultures and its body of knowledge are different. Different fields, different domains, whether it's imaging or its biology or its physics, each one of them need their own domain of foundation models.\",\n",

Most people don't talk about the pre and post processing because it's maybe not as sexy and not as interesting. However, it turns out that preprocessing and post-processing oftentimes consumes half or two-thirds of the overall workload. And so by accelerating the entire end-to-end pipeline, from preprocessing, from data ingestion, data processing, all the way to the preprocessing all the way to post processing, we're able to accelerate the entire pipeline versus just accelerating half of the pipeline.\",\n",

So it seems like the incremental TAM is easily in the several hundred thousands of GPUs and easily in the tens of billions of dollars.

And so, acceleration is necessary to achieve the necessary level of cost efficiency scale and energy efficiency scale so that we can continue to increase workloads while saving money and saving power. Accelerated computing is recognized generally as the path forward as general purpose computing slows.',\n",

And so, you could see that our company is indexed to two things, both of which are more important than ever, which is power efficiency, cost efficiency and then, of course, productivity.

And so, over the last year or so, we've been working on moving all of our software stacks to the cloud are of our platform and software stacks to the cloud.

So is the charge related to just working A100 inventory down faster? Is that what the charges related to?',\n",
       "    \"Sure. So let me talk about the first statement that you indicated.

       "    'Thanks, Simona. This was a challenging quarter. Total revenue of $6.7 billion was down 19% sequentially and up 3% year on year, below the $8.1 billion outlook we provided on our last earnings call. As we had indicated in our pre-announcement press release on August 8, we experienced a shortfall to our expectations driven primarily by weaker Gaming revenue.',\n",
       "    'Today, we will share with you more details on our Q2 results and Q3 outlook. Starting with Gaming. Revenue of $2.04 billion was down 44% sequentially and down 33% year on year, reflecting challenging market conditions. As discussed in May, we expected a sequential decline in Gaming revenue due to softness in Europe related to the war in Ukraine and COVID lockdowns in China.',\n",
       "    'The decline in Gaming GPU revenue was sharper than anticipated driven by both lower units and lower ASPs. Macroeconomic headwinds across the world drove a sudden slowdown in consumer demand. We implemented programs with our Gaming channel partners to adjust pricing in the channel and to price-position current high-end desktop GPUs as we prepare for a new architecture launch. As noted last quarter, we had expected cryptocurrency money to make a diminishing contribution to Gaming demand.',\n",
       "    \"We are unable to accurately quantify the extent to which reduced crypto money contributed to the decline in Gaming demand. While Gaming navigates significant short-term macroeconomic challenges, we believe the long-term fundamentals in Gaming remain strong. NVIDIA RTX has redefined computer graphics and is now supported by almost 300 games and applications. NVIDIA's GeForce GPUs are the most coveted brand by gamers, representing 15 of the top 15 most popular GPUs on Steam.\",\n",
       "    'Gaming has emerged from the pandemic an even more popular form of entertainment and social connectivity. Estimated GeForce sell-through is up over 70% since before the pandemic, and peak concurrent users on Steam are also up more than 70% over the same time period. GeForce now registered members now exceed 20 million. This quarter, we added 80 more titles, including the hugely popular Genshin Impact, bringing our total to over 1,350.',\n",
       "    'Moving to Professional Visualization. Revenue of $496 million was down 20% sequentially and down 4% from a year ago. A sequential increase in mobile revenue was more than offset by lower desktop revenue, particularly at the high end. As macroeconomic headwinds intensified, enterprise demand slowed and OEMs worked to reduce inventory.',\n",
       "    \"We expect these trends to persist in Q3. While ProViz is undergoing a near-term adjustment after doubling last year, we believe we have expanded the market opportunity over the last couple of years with AI and Omniverse workloads. We believe hybrid work is here to stay, and with it, the need for collaborative 3D design enabled by professional graphic workstations, both at home and in the office, as well as in the cloud. In June, we announced a partnership with Siemens to enable the industrial levers and AI-powered digital twins, connecting Siemens' Xcelerator platform to NVIDIA Omniverse.\",\n",
       "    \"This connection opens Siemens to the vast ecosystem of NVIDIA Omniverse and NVIDIA to Siemens' ecosystem of the world's largest industries. Earlier this month at SIGGRAPH, the Premier Computer Graphics Conference, we announced advancements to several foundational technologies of the metaverse, defined as the 3D version of the Internet. First, NVIDIA Omniverse Avatar Cloud Engine will enable businesses to create and deploy assistants and avatars, transforming interactions across a range of industries. We also unveiled 11 new Omniverse connectors, bringing the total number of connectors to the Omniverse USD ecosystem to 112.\",\n",
       "    'And finally, we released SDKs for the new field of neural graphics, which intertwines AI and graphics to help automate the creation of virtual worlds. Moving to Automotive. Revenue of $220 million increased 59% sequentially and 45% from the year ago quarter. Strong growth was driven by auto AI solutions, which include AI cockpit and self-driving revenue, with particular strength in self-driving as new energy vehicle design wins ramp into volume.',\n",
       "    \"We believe Q2 was an inflection point for our Automotive revenue as NVIDIA Orin has great momentum. During the quarter, we announced rollout plans of new vehicles from OEM partners, NIO, Li Auto, JIDU and Human Horizons, as well as Pony.ai's line of self-driving trucks and robotaxis, all built on NVIDIA DRIVE. Looking forward, we expect our $11 billion Automotive design win pipeline to translate to continued growth. Moving to Data Center.\",\n",
       "    'Revenue of $3.81 billion grew 1% sequentially and 61% year on year. Although a record, this was somewhat short of our expectations as we were impacted by supply chain disruptions. Revenue from hyperscale customers nearly doubled year on year. Sequentially, sales to North America hyperscale and cloud computing customers increased but were more than offset by lower sales to China hyperscale customers affected by domestic economic conditions.',\n",
       "    'Vertical industries grew both sequentially and year on year. Key workloads driving growth include natural language processing, recommender systems, autonomous vehicle fleet data processing and training and cloud graphics. Let me share a couple of customer examples. Pinterest transitioned to 100x larger recommender models by moving its inference from CPUs to NVIDIA GPUs.',\n",
       "    'Its ability to deploy a higher-quality model at high throughput and low latency resulted in a 16% increase in engagement, a critical metric for the company, which has over 400 million users and 300 billion images. And Tesla recently upgraded its supercomputer to use over 7,000 A100 GPUs for autopilot training. From a product perspective, networking led growth this quarter with strong demand from our high-speed Ethernet adapters and design win momentum toward next-generation adapters, including the ConnectX-6 and ConnectX-7. We also see growing interest from cloud service providers for our new Spectrum-4 400-gigabit per second Ethernet networking platform.',\n",
       "    'Additionally, we are ramping into the upcoming launches of our next-generation platforms. The Hopper architecture flagship H100 data center GPU is in production. Grace is our first CPU. Top computer makers, including Dell, HPE, Inspur, Lenovo and Supermicro are adopting the new NVIDIA Grace CPU Superchip and Grace Hopper Superchip to build the next generation of supers.',\n",
       "    \"72% of the systems on the latest top 500 list of the world's fastest supercomputers are powered by NVIDIA, including 31 of 39 new systems. NVIDIA's own Selene supercomputer ranks at No. 8 in the top 500 and is the world's fastest enterprise supercomputer. Moreover, 22 of the top 30 systems on the Green500 list of the most energy-efficient supercomputers are powered by NVIDIA.\",\n",
       "    'Significant advances in software technologies are key to our platform performance. In the past two years, our A100-based platform has delivered 6x more performance as measured by the MLPerf industry benchmark, largely through new software technologies and optimizations. Last month, we announced an update to the NeMo Megatron framework that can speed up the training of large language models by up to 30%. Improving a multi-hundred million-dollar AI infrastructure by 30% translates to significant value for customers.',\n",

Currently, these capabilities are available to early access customers to run on NVIDIA GTX SUPER products and NVIDIA DGX Foundry, as well as in Microsoft Azure cloud, with other product platforms available soon. We are working with the industry leaders in large language models, a very active and exciting space of AI.',\n",
       "    'Moving to the rest of the P&L. GAAP gross margin was 43.5%, and non-GAAP gross margin was 45.9%. Gross margin includes $1.22 billion in charges for inventory and related reserves based on revised expectations of future demand and $122 million for warranty reserves. These charges incurred in the quarter reflect purchase commitments that we made during a time of severe component shortages and our current expectation of ongoing macro uncertainty.',\n",
       "    'We believe our long-term gross margin profile is intact. GAAP operating expenses were up 36% from a year ago and down 32% sequentially as Q1 included a $1.35 billion acquisition termination charge related to the Arm transaction. Non-GAAP operating expenses were up 38% from a year ago and up 9% sequentially. These increases were driven primarily by employee growth costs, as well as increases in salaries to support our employees during this high inflationary environment and engineering development of new products coming to market.',\n",
       "    'We have slowed operating expense growth, balancing investments for long-term revenue growth, while managing near-term profitability. Our full year non-GAAP opex is expected to grow over 30%. During the first half of fiscal 2023, we returned $5.5 billion to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and cash dividends. We plan to continue share repurchases.',\n",
       "    \"We have nearly $12 billion remaining under our authorization through December of 2023. Let me turn to the outlook for the third quarter of fiscal '23. We expect Gaming and ProViz revenue to decline sequentially as OEMs and channel partners reduce inventory levels to align with current levels of demand and prepare for our new product generation. We expect that decline to be partially offset by sequential growth in Data Center and Automotive.\",\n",
       "    'Revenue is expected to be $5.9 billion, plus or minus 2%. GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 62.4% and 65%, respectively, plus or minus 50 basis points. GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $2.59 billion. Non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $1.82 billion.',\n",
       "    'GAAP and non-GAAP other income and expenses are expected to be an expense of approximately $10 million, excluding gains and losses on nonaffiliated investments. GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates are expected to be 9.5%, plus or minus 1%, excluding any discrete items. Capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $550 million to $600 million.

We will be attending the Jefferies conference in Chicago on August 30 and the Goldman Sachs conference in San Francisco on September 12. And we will be holding a financial analyst Q&A with management, following Jensen's GTC keynote, on September 20. Our earnings call to discuss the results of our third quarter of fiscal 2023 is scheduled for Wednesday, November 16.\",\n",
       "    'We will now open the call for questions. Operator, can you assist? Would you please poll for questions?',\n",
       "    'Questions & Answers:',\n",
       "    '[Operator instructions] Your first question comes from the line of C.J. Muse with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.',\n",
       "    'Yeah, good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. I think the question we all have is what is normalized revenues for Gaming for you guys. Obviously, this is a challenge for you as well.',\n",
       "    \"But curious how you're thinking about it today. Is the fiscal '20 recovery post the first half '19 correction an appropriate framework? Or was that inflated by crypto as well? And I guess, as part of that, how do we think about the cascading in of the new product cycle? And is there potential for future reserves needed to be taken if Gaming does not meet your new updated outlook? Thanks so much.\",\n",
       "    \"Well, let me start first there and see if I can assist in terms of how to think about after we get through our completion just now of Q2 and what we have provided here for guidance for Q3. Across those two quarters, the Q2 of '23, the Q3 of '23, we have likely undershipped Gaming to our end demand significantly. We expect that sell-through or essentially our end demand for those combined two quarters of Q2 and Q3 to be approximately $5 billion. Now on top of this, keep in mind that we do have Gaming growth drivers to consider for the future.\",\n",
       "    \"These can include our new Gaming product introductions that are around the corner, as well as new segments of the market that we plan to reach with our Gaming technology, to just name a couple. I'll turn it over to Jensen to talk a little bit more about that. Now regarding any further types of write-downs on this perspective, we did a thorough assessment with this quarter, not only just looking at what we needed for this quarter, but what we needed for the long term. Keep in mind, our inventory provisions and write-downs that we took into account had to reflect some of the purchasing that we did a supply back more than a year ago, when we were still in extreme supply shortages in almost all of our products.\",\n",
       "    \"And so this was an opportunity for us to resize given the macroeconomic conditions, what we needed in terms of supply. So our expectations were higher, and we took this opportunity to write them down to what our current expectations are. I'll turn it over to Jensen to see if he wants to add more.\",\n",
       "    \"And so our first strategy is to reduce sell-in in the next couple of quarters to correct channel inventory. We've also instituted programs to price-position our current products to prepare for next-generation products. Ampere is the most popular GPU we've ever created. It is in the top 15 most popular gaming GPUs on Steam.\",\n",
       "    \"All of this, we anticipate, were working toward a path to being in a good shape going into next year, OK? So that's what our game plan is.\",\n",
       "    'Your next question will come from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America Securities. Your line is open.',\n",
       "    'Thanks for taking my question. Actually, I just wanted to clarify, Jensen, so should we assume that a Gaming sell-in will kind of stay at these levels into your Q1 or Q2, or depending on new product launch, it might recover? So I just wanted to make sure our baseline assumption is set there. And then my question is actually similar, on the Data Center. Sales are pretty strong right now, but there is a concern that Data Center capex could be the next shoe to drop in this rolling correction in semiconductors.',\n",
       "    \"I'm curious, what's your sense of utilization of your Data Center shipments? And what is the risk that there could be a correction in the Data Center given some of the macro caution expressed by some of the hyperscaler and enterprise customers?\",\n",
       "    'Yeah. Thanks, Vivek. The sell-through, the sell-through as I mentioned earlier, of GeForce is solid. The end-market gaming demand is solid.',\n",
       "    \"We believe that by the end of the year, we'll be in a good shape going into next year. And so I hope that answers your question, but the important thing is our sell-in rate is far below what is happening in the market for sell-throughs. The sell-through is solid, has increased 70% since pre-COVID. And so the gaming market is really quite vibrant.\",\n",
       "    \"And so the impact of this area is really quite worth staying close to. It's called large language models. I think Stanford did a paper that called it foundation models, that could be used for training all kinds of other types of AIs. And so we're seeing a great deal of demand for GPUs in the cloud.\",\n",
       "    'Your next question will come from the line of Matt Ramsay with Cowen. Your line is open.',\n",
       "    \"Thank you very much. Good afternoon. I wanted to follow up on the Data Center question that Vivek just asked from a couple of angles. I guess, Colette, the first angle being, in the release, you guys talked about pulling, I don't know, high-$200 millions of revenue into the July quarter from October, but also with supply chain challenges, maybe some deliveries that were meant for July got pushed back into October.\",\n",
       "    'Thanks.',\n",
       "    \"Great. Thanks for the question. And it's kind of a little bit of an add-on to some of the statements that Jensen was discussing regarding our supply chain and what we're seeing today. Our supply chain during the quarter really was quite difficult, was quite challenging to work through.\",\n",
       "    \"Our platforms, including HDX, networking chips, cables, switches, were very important to the customers. It's not just about us selling the GPUs. So even though customers order those components themselves, they're looking from us for what we may refer to as kits, kits that go with those GPUs for them to stand up their data centers. We also experienced supply disruptions internally with our logistics and our component availability.\",\n",
       "    \"Some of our supply arrived very late in the quarter. We had very little time, from a logistics and availability, to get those things out. Customers were impacted as well by availability of key third-party other components that we weren't offering, which were slowing down some of their deployments. So what we did in our Q2 orders that couldn't be delivered in Q3, given that some of these supply constraints existed, and we had Q3 demand where we did have supply in Q2, so we worked with customers to optimize that supply and demand.\",\n",
       "    \"And that's what we've disclosed to you.\",\n",
       "    \"And so I fully expect investment to return. They're a very important market for us, a very large market for us. And the fact that North American hyperscalers doubled year over year, our revenues at North American hyperscalers, and that was offset by declines in China, says something about the slowdown in China. And so I don't think that's going to last forever.\",\n",
       "    \"I think it's going to return. With respect to Hopper, we're in full production now. And we're racing to get Hopper to all of the CSPs who are dying to get them. And it goes with our HGXs, which is multiple Hoppers on a system tray.\",\n",
       "    \"It's really a supercomputer in a motherboard, if you will. And it goes along with it networking gear and switch gear. And so there's the enormous amounts of resources applied from all of the CSPs around the world and ourselves to get Hopper to them. We expect to ship substantial Hoppers in Q4.\",\n",
       "    'Your next question will come from the line of Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.',\n",
       "    'Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks so much for taking the question. I had a question regarding the $1.22 billion inventory charge, maybe for Colette, on this one specifically.',\n",
       "    \"In the CFO commentary, I think you state that the inventory charge is related to weaker demand in both Data Center and Gaming. I think the Gaming side is pretty clear based on your comments so far. Curious what's changed on the Data Center side? Is it mostly the Chinese hyperscalers that Jensen just spoke to? Or is there something else going on in terms of how you're thinking about demand in Data Center over the next couple of quarters? And related to this, curious if the delay in Sapphire Rapids at Intel is having an impact on your business in the near to medium term. Thank you.\",\n",
       "    \"Thanks for the question. So our inventory charges, as we commented, we're taking a thorough look of not only this last quarter, as well as the quarter that we're guiding, but looking over the long term of what we need for demand and then what we had in terms of supply. Remember, we had purchased this very early on in the year as we needed to, to drive the commitment of the supply that we already have. And so what is happening here for the Data Center, we had great, high expectations.\",\n",
       "    \"We still have very strong, solid growth projection for Data Center as well. But we're going to take this opportunity for some of the prior architecture pieces, to write down those, given what we see as just a change in terms of our expectations going forward. So you are correct. There are also pieces in there for Gaming.\",\n",
       "    \"We have written down some silicon and chips as the macroeconomic conditions and we get ready for our future product launches, taken into account, but there's also components, services and capacity and some of the other drivers that are incorporated in those write-downs.\",\n",
       "    'And they intend to deploy NVIDIA accelerators, NVIDIA Hoppers, across a large number of CPUs. There is no question that the delay is disruptive and a lot of engineers have to scramble. It would have been a lot easier if next-generation CPUs were to have executed more perfectly. However, Hopper goes into an environment with CSPs where they connect our PCI Express connectors to old-generation, current-generation CPUs as well.',\n",
       "    \"And so nobody likes the delay. The next-generation CPUs will trigger a refresh of infrastructure and new servers. And so I'm super excited about them. However, we're going to be able to go to market plenty fine with Hopper supporting existing infrastructure.\",\n",
       "    'Your next question will come from the line of Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.',\n",
       "    'Do you think that Hopper, as that comes fully available, it sounds like in fiscal 4Q, that you actually see Data Center growth reaccelerate as that product cycle materializes?',\n",
       "    \"Yeah. Thanks for the question. And that's a pretty good understanding of our guidance. And we do expect, yes, Gaming to decrease, not in the dollar amount that it decreased between Q1 and Q2.\",\n",
       "    \"So that may be, of our two areas of the decline, our Gaming and ProViz, that may be about three-quarters of it associated with that Gaming, and then Professional Visualization would probably be about one quarter of the two areas that will decline. Our Data Center, yes, we do expect it to grow. It may grow about what we just saw between Q1 and Q2. We'll continue to look at it.\",\n",
       "    \"There may be some more opportunity there. And Automotive, very similar to our thoughts at the very beginning of the quarter. We are expecting continued growth through each of the quarters of this fiscal year. We felt that Q2 was an inflection point, so we'll continue to grow into Q3 and hopefully Q4 going forward.\",\n",
       "    \"I'll turn it over to Jensen to see his thoughts in terms of Hopper, what Hopper brings to us in Q4, and the expectations.\",\n",
       "    \"Hopper is a giant new generation because it is designed to perform this new type of AI model called Transformers. It has an engine inside it called Transformer engine, with numerical formats and pipelines that allows us to do a spectacular job on Transformer-type of models, which includes large language models, but it also includes computer vision models that are now able to be processed with this new type of AI model called Transformers. And so I fully expect Hopper to be the next springboard for future growth. And the importance of this new model, Transformers, can't possibly be understated and can't be overstated.\",\n",
       "    \"This is the impact of this model across robotics, computer vision, languages, biology, chemistry, drug design, is just really quite spectacular. And I'm sure that you've been hearing about this new breakthrough in AI, and Hopper was designed for this.\",\n",
       "    'Your next question will come from the line of Atif Malik with Citi. Your line is open.',\n",
       "    'Hi. Thank you for taking my question. Colette, can you talk about networking versus compute? Were they both supply constrained in the July quarter? And are they both sequentially growing in the October quarter?',\n",
       "    \"So within our Q2 results, we have been continuing to improve our supply for networking. We have a lot of important products that the CSP needs, many of our customers need, and we have been working to really improve that supply. And we were able to set very strong growth in terms of networking, both sequentially and year over year. And as we move into the next quarter, we're going to have to see which is going to be growth larger.\",\n",
       "    \"We're just going to have to take a look once we finish that quarter. But our supply for compute is here. But as we have discussed, sometimes, it's important that they have many of our other components that we provide in networking at the same time that we are providing the GPUs. So sometimes, those are very important for us to deliver together.\",\n",
       "    \"So we always have to keep that in mind. So it's not always supply constrained, but there are certain parts of it that are.\",\n",
       "    'Your next question will come from the line of Joseph Moore with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.',\n",
       "    \"Great. Thank you. I wanted to ask, why did the supply constraints hit you guys so hard this quarter. I mean you've done such a great job in the last couple of years, outgrowing really everybody in a very challenging supply chain environment.\",\n",
       "    \"Let me start and see if Jensen wants to add on to it. Our execution has absolutely been phenomenal, when we think about the challenges of we're almost putting together a full data center for our customers and getting it shipped out. So we're no different. In the same way that the CSPs are challenging, we're setting up their data centers as we're such an integral part of that.\",\n",
       "    'And so networking has been short of supply. These are the same supply issues that some of our CSPs are having. So our supply arrived a little bit late in the quarter for some of our key products that we needed to get out. And putting that together caused some disruption in our logistics and distribution.',\n",

       "    'Your next question will come from the line of Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein. Your line is open.',\n",
       "    \"Can you give us a feeling for how much of that charge was Data Center versus Gaming? And then the follow-up on that, it did sound like, to me, that it was mostly Ampere and not Hopper change in expectations. Can you verify that or clarify it? And just talk about what's happened with your expectations for Hopper? Have they gone up or down? Or has there been any change at all relevant to that inventory charge?\",\n",
       "    \"Yeah, Stacy. Regarding our inventory charges that we had, when you think about what we have in supply, whether it be chips, components, whether it be memory, remember, a lot of these things can be used interchangeably across the two. Additionally, the value of our inventory for Data Center is much different than the value of what we have for Gaming from an overall cost perspective. So we're creating capacity opportunities, putting together all of those systems in terms of Data Center.\",\n",
       "    \"It is prior architectures. Absolutely, this is not a question regarding anything of our future products coming to market. Nothing on the inventory provision has to do with that. So we took this as looking at the macroeconomic conditions, as we've discussed.\",\n",
       "    \"Our expectations, our plans, were higher. They're still quite solid, that we see in demand both for Gaming, as well as solid for Data Center. And that will continue. But we did have to just take a rightsizing of that inventory.\",\n",
       "    \"Hopper was designed for Transformers. The new Transformers was going to be important. Nobody could have predicted the profound importance of large language models. Large language models, excitement, innovation, ideas, companies, start-ups, industries, all exceeding everyone's expectations.\",\n",
       "    \"I don't think anybody could have predicted the impact of Transformers as it scaled up to these giant sizes. There's a fair amount of literature now written about language models that were smallish in the old days, in the beginning, several years ago, three years ago. And the ones that are in the hundreds of billions and moving toward probably several trillion parameters, the effectiveness of the AI is really quite spectacular. And to have AI that was never trained on a particular skill and yet within one shot or one shot of trying or even no shots, are able to perform that skill, is beyond anybody's expectations, I would think.\",\n",
       "    'Your next question will come from the line of Srini Pajjuri with SMBC Nikko. Your line is open.',\n",
       "    \"Thank you. I have a question on gross margins, Colette. The 65% non-GAAP number you're guiding to, does that include or assume any additional write-offs on the inventory front? And then just to expand on that, your mix is probably a tailwind to gross margins given that Gaming is down significantly and that Data Center is up a little bit. And I'm just wondering, are there any other offsets because I would have thought gross margins could actually be better than your longer-term model because of the mix tailwinds.\",\n",
       "    'Thank you.',\n",
       "    'Yeah. Thanks for the question. So our gross margins outside of the inventory charges in Q2, as well as going into Q3 is really about our sales mix that we have and probably also to understand that our sales mix in the next quarter for GPUs is not in the high end. And so that has impacted our gross margin as we move into Q3.',\n",
       "    \"You are correct. We do expect that Data Center will assist in our gross margins, but we also have growth plans in Auto. Auto is below our company average, and so that will tend to offset some of those upper-bound things that we will see in terms of Data Center. From time to time, there's always a small amount of scraps that we will have in our gross margin estimates.\",\n",
       "    'So nothing material is planned, but there is small scraps that may occur from quarter to quarter that are included in our gross margins.',\n",

       "    'Thanks a lot. Colette, I had a clarification and then a question. So my clarification is whether October gross margins are benefiting at all from the sale of previously written down inventory. And then my question is whether you can give us the enterprise cloud split in Data Center because it sounds like the mix shifted more toward enterprise in July.',\n",
       "    \"And I think investors might want to see that as risky in the face of enterprise clearly slowing. So I'm wondering if you can give us that. Thanks.\",\n",
       "    'OK. No. No, there is nothing in our Q3 regarding those inventory provisions that we took in terms of earning that back, in terms of our Q3. Regarding our split between our hyperscalers and data centers and what we refer to as our vertical industries, they always tend to be about the same, 50% for one, 50% for the others.',\n",
       "    \"They're still in about that range. We had discussed that our China hyperscalers did not drive growth in terms of sequentially here. And so that did influence in terms of the hyperscalers, but still we are approximately in that 50%, 50%.\",\n",
       "    'Your next question will come from the line of Harlan Sur with J.P. Morgan. Your line is open.',\n",
       "    \"Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. On the weakness in ProViz, this is an enterprise-focused business, right? Granted, it's a somewhat narrow vertical market, but it does sort of play into the market concerns that consumer is weak now, enterprise is the next shoe to drop. So is the decline in ProViz attributed to enterprise spending weakness? Or is there some other dynamic? And why or why not is this not a leading indicator for your enterprise and vertical industry segments within your Data Center business?\",\n",
       "    \"So our Pro Visualization business, just in such a short time, they were in short supply and really trying to feed so much of the industry's desire to both refresh and attracted to the new RTX workstations that were there. We were fueling both mobile, as well as desktop for that market and growing quite nicely. Remember, all of last year doubled the size of ProViz in one year. So right now, the OEMs are concentrating on their levels of inventory.\",\n",
       "    'OK? And your second question, remind me again.',\n",
       "    \"And so in the case of ProViz, the companies that are buying ProViz, our ProViz systems, likely already have systems that they've been using. And so if they were to tighten up ProViz, for whatever reason, the people could continue to use what they have. In the case of our AI business, there's no real installed base. These are all brand-new things that people are growing into.\",\n",
       "    \"And the productivity benefits or the cost savings benefits of using autonomous systems is fairly profound. And it's not so much that the demand isn't out there. Everybody would like to be more productive. Everybody would like to save more money.\",\n",
       "    \"Everybody would like to move faster. It's just that AI's understanding and AI's use is still spreading. And so we're delighted by the rate of growth and the rate of adoption of enterprise. My sense is that our AI business and our Viz business have very different characteristics for that reason.\",\n",
       "    'But what Colette said earlier is, about our ProViz businesses last quarter, is absolutely true, which is OEMs realizing that the end market is slowing and taking the opportunity to correct their inventory.',\n",
       "    'Your final question will come from the line of Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.',\n",
       "    \"Hey, guys. Thanks for letting me ask a question. I just had a longer-term question about once your Gaming business normalizes, with the absence of crypto in a general sense and with the merge coming, etc., how do you view the pricing environment? I know you guys really weren't raising prices like we saw in the MSRP premiums in the aftermarket. But generally, your mix was quite rich over the last year or two.\",\n",
       "    \"You're going to have Lovelace coming in that will obviously help the mix sequentially versus the last couple of quarters. But how do you think about it normalizing? If that $2.5 billion per quarter sell-through rate comes, is the ASP mix across your stack about the same, or does it go down because of the absence of that crypto-tightening dynamic?\",\n",
       "    \"And the reason for that is because it's more useful than ever. You use your game console for your greatest form of entertainment, and you use it for a very, very long time. And GeForce essentially is a game console inside your PC. And we've always believed that the ASP of GeForce should drift toward the average selling price of a game console.\",\n",
       "    \"And so the GeForce is not just for gaming for them, the GeForce is essentially their creative workstation as well. And so there are several dynamics that are causing the ASP of GeForce to go up, and we've been seeing this trend for several years now.\",\n",

Total revenue of $8.3 billion was a record, up 8% sequentially and up 46% year on year. Data Center has become our largest market platform, and we see continued strong momentum going forward.',\n",
       "    'Starting with Gaming. Revenue of $3.6 billion rose 6% sequentially and 31% year on year, powered by the GeForce RTX 30 Series product cycle. Since launching in the fall of 2020, the RTX 30 Series has been our best Gaming product cycle ever. The gaming industry has grown tremendously with 100 million new PC gamers added in the past two years according to Newzoo.',\n",
       "    \"And NVIDIA RTX has set new standard for the industry with demand from both first-time GPU buyers as well as those upgrading their PCs to experience the 250-plus RTX-optimized games and apps, double from last year. We estimate that almost a third of the GeForce Gaming GPU installed base is now on RTX. RTX has brought tremendous energy into the gaming world, and has helped drive a sustained expansion in our higher-end platforms and installed base with significant runway still ahead. Overall, end demand remained solid though mixed by region, and demand in America's remained strong.\",\n",
       "    'However, we started seeing softness in parts of Europe related to the war in the Ukraine and parts of China due to the COVID lockdowns. As we expect some ongoing impact as we prepare for a new architectural transition later in the year, we are projecting Gaming revenue to decline sequentially in Q2. Channel inventory has nearly normalized and we expect it to remain around these levels in Q2. The extent in which cryptocurrency mining contributed to Gaming demand is difficult for us to quantify with any reasonable degree of precision.',\n",
       "    \"The reduced pace of increase in Ethereum network hash rate likely reflects lower mining activity on GPUs. We expect a diminishing contribution going forward. Laptop Gaming revenue posted strong sequential and year-on-year growth, driven by the ramp of the NVIDIA RTX 30 Series lineup. With this year's spring refresh and ahead of the upcoming back-to-school season, there are now over 180 laptop models featuring RTX 30 Series GPUs and our energy-efficient thin and light Max-Q technologies, up from 140 at this time last year.\",\n",

       "    \"Q1 revenue was $622 million was down sequentially 3% and up 67% from a year ago. Demand remains strong as enterprises continued to build out their employee's remote office infrastructure to support hybrid work.

Revenue from hyperscale and cloud computing customers more than doubled year on year, driven by strong demand for both external and internal workloads.',\n",
       "    'Customers remain supply constrained in their infrastructure needs and continue to add capacity as they try to keep pace with demand. Revenue from vertical industries grew a strong double-digit percentage from last year. Top verticals driving growth this quarter include; consumer Internet companies, financial services, and telecom.

Recent industry breakthroughs traced to transformers include large language models like GPT-3, NVIDIA Megatron BERT for drug discovery, and DeepMind AlphaFold for a protein structure prediction.',\n",
       "    'Transformers allow self-supervised learning without the need for human labeled data. They enable unprecedented levels of accuracy for TAF such as text generation, translation, summarization and answering questions.

The several things that are driving the Gaming the last two years alone, 100 million new gamers came into the PC industry. The format has expanded tremendously. And the ways that people are using their PCs to connect with friends, to be an influencer as a platform for themselves, use it for broadcast.',\n",

In this upcoming cycle with H-100, there's some I/O upgrades that are happening in servers that I think are going to be a fairly strong driver for you in addition to what's going on with Hopper and the huge performance leaps that are there.\",\n",
       "    \"I wanted to ask a longer-term question, though, around your move to NVLink with Grace and Hopper and what's going on with your whole portfolio. Do you envision the business continuing to be sort of card-driven attached to third-party servers, or do you think revenue shifts dramatically, or in a small way, over time, to be more sort of vertically integrated all of the chips together on NVLink? And how is the industry sort of responding to that potential move? Thanks.\",\n",
       "    \"The I/O performance is substantially higher than what was available before. And so you're going to see a pretty large refresh as a result of that. Brand-new networking cards from our company and others. Gen 5, of course, drives new platform refresh.\",\n",
       "    \"And so, we're perfectly timed to ramp into the Gen 5 generation with Hopper. There are a lot of different system configurations you want to make. If you take a step back and look at the type of systems that are necessary for data processing, scientific computing, machine learning and training, inference done in the cloud for hyperscale nature, done on-prem for enterprise computing, done at the edge. Each one of these workloads and deployment locations, the way that you manage would dictate a different system architecture.\",\n",
       "    \"And you're starting to see that now with fairly large installations, infrastructures with NVIDIA, HPC and NVIDIA AI. These are really AI factories where you're processing the data, refining the data and turning that data into intelligence. These AI factories are essentially running one major workload and they're running at 24/7. Deep recommender systems is a good example of that.\",\n",
       "    \"In the future, you're going to see large language models essentially becoming a platform themselves. That would be running 24/7, hosting a whole bunch of applications.

If you listen to the networking OEMs, this earnings season, it seems that there was a lot of talk about increased spending by enterprises on their data centers and sometimes you hear them talking about how this is being driven by AI. You talked about your year-over-year growth in your cloud versus enterprise spending.',\n",
       "    \"Yeah. Thanks, Mark. We had a record Data Center business this last quarter. We expect to have a record, another record quarter this quarter, and we're fairly enthusiastic about the second half.\",\n",
       "    'AI and data-driven machine learning techniques for writing software and extracting insight from the vast amount of data that companies have is incredibly strategic to all the companies that we know. Because in the final analysis, AI is about automation of intelligence and most companies are about domain-specific intelligence. We want to produce intelligence. And there are several techniques now that have been created to make it possible for most companies to apply their data to extract insight and to automate a lot of the predictive things that they have to do and do it quickly.',\n",
       "    \"And so I think the trend that you hear other people are experiencing about machine learning, data analytics, data driven insights, artificial intelligence. However, it's described, it's all exactly the same thing. And it's sweeping just about every industry and every company. Our networking business is also highly supply constrained.\",\n",
       "    \"And so the supply chain has been problematic. We're doing our best and our supply has been increasing from Q4 to Q1. We're expecting it to increase in Q2 and increase in Q3 and Q4. And so we're really, really grateful for the support from the component industry around us, and we'll be able to increase that.\",\n",
       "    'But anyhow, all of these different models need an engine to run on. And that engine is called NVIDIA AI. In the case of hyperscalers, they can cobble together a lot of open source and we provide a lot of our source to them and a lot of our engines to them for them to operate their AI. But for enterprises, they need someone to package it together and be able to support it and refresh it, update it for new architecture, support old architectures in their installed base, etcetera, and all the different use cases that they have.',\n",
       "    \"And so that engine is called NVIDIA AI. It's almost like a sequel engine, if you will. And except this is an engine for artificial intelligence.

And then my question is gentleman for you. You're still guiding Data Center to a very strong, I think, close to 70% or so year-on-year growth, despite all the headwinds.\",\n",
       "    'Are you worried at all about all the headlines about the slowdown in the macro economy? I like is there any cyclical impact on Data Center growth that we should keep in mind as we think about the second half of the year?',\n",
       "    \"Yes. Vivek, let me first answer the question that you asked regarding any new products as we look at Q2. As we discussed about it, most of the ramp that we have of our new architectures, we're going to see in the back half of the year. We're going to start to see, for example, Hopper will probably be here in Q3, but starting to ramp closer to the end of the calendar year.\",\n",
       "    \"So, you should think about most of our product launches to be ramping in the second half of the year on that part. I'll turn it over for Jensen Huang for the rest.\",\n",
       "    \"Thanks. Our Data Center demand is strong and remains strong. Hyperscale and cloud computing revenues, as you mentioned, has grown significantly. It's doubled year over year.\",\n",
       "    \"and we're seeing really strong adoption of A100. A100 is really quite special and unique in the world of accelerators. And this is one of the really, really great innovations as we extended our GPU from graphics to CUDA to Tensor Core GPUs. It's now a universal accelerator.\",\n",
       "    'And so you could use it for data processing for ETL, for example, extract, transform, and load. You could use it for database acceleration. Many sequel functions are accelerated on NVIDIA GPUs. We accelerate Rapids, we accelerate which is the Python version a Data Center scale version of Pandas, we accelerate Spark 3.0.',\n",
       "    \"And so from database queries to data processing, to extraction, and transform and loading of data before you do training and inference and whatever image processing or other algorithmic processing you need to do can be fully accelerated on A100. And so we're seeing great success there. On at the core and closer to what is happening today, you're seeing several different very important new AI models that are being invested in at very, very large scale and with great urgency. You probably have heard about Deep Recommender Systems.\",\n",
       "    \"This is the economic engine, the information filtering engine of the Internet, if not for the recommender system, it would be practically impossible for us to enjoy our Internet experience shopping experience with trillions of things that are changing in the world every day constantly and be able to use your three-inch phone to even engage the Internet. And so all of that magic is made possible by this incredible thing call a recommender system second thing is conversational AI. You're seeing chat bots and website customer service, even live customer service being now supported by AI, conversational AI has an opportunity to enhance the customer service on the one hand. On the other hand, supplement for a lot of labor shortage.\",\n",
       "    \"And then the third is this groundbreaking piece of work as related to Transformers that led to natural language understanding breakthrough. But within it, is this incredible thing called large language models, which embeds human knowledge because it's been trained and so much data. And we recently announced Megatron 530B. And it was a collaboration we did with Microsoft, the foundation of – I think they call it Turing.\",\n",
       "    \"And this language model and others like it, like open AI, GPD 3 are really transformative and they take an enormous amount of computation. However, the net result is a pre-trade model that is really quite remarkable. Now we're working with thousands of start-ups, large companies that are building who are using the public cloud. And so it's driving a lot of demand for us in the public cloud.\",\n",
       "    \"I think we have now 10,000 AI inception start-ups that are working with us and using NVIDIA AI, whether it's on-prem or in the cloud, it saves money, because the computation time is significantly reduced. The quality of service is a lot better and they could do greater things. And so that's driving AI in the cloud. And so all of these different factors, whether it's just the industrial recognition of the importance of AI, the transformative nature of these new AI models recommender systems, large language models, conversational AI.\",\n",
       "    \"Next, we'll go to Tim Arcuri with UBS. Your line is open.\",\n",
       "    \"Thank you very much. I had a question about this $500 million impact for July and whether it's more supply related or demand related. And that's because most others in semis are sort of setting this China stuff, in particular, is more of a logistics issues, so more of a supply issues, but the language Colette you were using in your commentary side of lower sell-through in gaming and sort the absence of sales in Russia, to me that sounds a little more demand which would make sense in the context of this new freeze on hiring that you have. So I ask because if it's supply related, then you could argue that it's not perishable and really just timing.\",\n",
       "    'But if demand related that might never come back and it to be the beginning of a falling night. So, I wonder if you can sort of walk through that for me? Thanks.',\n",
       "    'Thanks, Tim, for the question. Let me try and bet here on the China and Russia, two very different things. The current China lockdowns that we are seeing interestingly has implications to both supply and demand. We have seen challenges in terms of the logistics throughout the country, things going in out of the country.',\n",
       "    \"It puts a lot of pressure on just logistics that were already under pressure. From a demand perspective, it has also been head from the gaming side. You have very large cities that are in full lockdown, focusing really on other important things for the citizens there. So, it's impacting our demand.\",\n",
       "    \"We do believe that they will come out of COVID and the demand for our products will come back. We do believe that will occur. The supply will sort it out. It's very difficult to determine how.\",\n",
       "    \"Now, in the case of Russia, we're not selling to Russia. That's something that we had announced earlier last quarter. But there were plans and Russia has been a part of our overall company revenue of probably about 2% of our company revenue historically and a little larger percentage when you look at our Gaming business. I hope that helped.\",\n",

       "    \"Hi. Thank you very much, Colette and Jensen. I actually really appreciate it that you called out demand from those two companies, it feels like it's healthy to say demand is a problem, so refreshing to hear that. I had a question on the second half and it relates to both Data Center as well as Gaming.\",\n",
       "    'So, last couple of times you have talked publicly, you have made comments that your visibility into the Data Center has never been better. So, I was wondering if you just take out the Russia impact, is that still true, all the orders that you have been getting there intact and you did say that business will see a strong momentum. I just want to make sure that statement of confidence you have made stays? And then on Gaming, Colette, do we expect second half to be up year over year just based on the guide for second quarter? It seems like it could be up sequentially but may not return to year-over-year growth in Q3. Thank you.',\n",
       "    'Yes. Ambrish, thanks for the question. On first principles, it should be the case that our visibility of Data Centers is vastly better, vastly better than a couple of years ago. And the reason for that is several.',\n",
       "    \"The type of industrial use cases for artificial intelligence requires labeling of data that's really quite difficult. And then now with Transformers, you have unsupervised learning and other techniques, zero-shot learning that allows us to do all kinds of interesting things without having to have human-labeled data. We even have synthetic generated data with Omniverse that helps customers do data generation without having to label data, which is either too costly, or quite frankly, oftentimes impossible. And so now, the knowledge and the technology has evolved to a place that most of the industries could use artificial intelligence at a fairly effective way and in many industries rather transformative.\",\n",
       "    'And so I think, number one, we went from clouds and hyperscalers to all of industries. Second, we went from training-focused to inference. Most people thought that inference was going to be easy. It turns out the inference is by far the harder.',\n",
       "    \"And the reason for that is because there are so many different models and there are so many different use cases and so many quality of service requirements, and you want to run these inference models in a small of a footprint as you can. And so when you scale out, the number of users that use the service is really quite high. So using acceleration, using NVIDIA's platform, we could inference any model from computer vision to speech to chemistry to biology, you name it. And we do it so quickly and so fast that the cost is very low.\",\n",
       "    'And so the more acceleration you do, the more money you will save. And that, I think, that wisdom is absolutely true. And so the second dimension is training to inference. The third dimension is that we now have so many different types of configurations of systems that we can go from high-performance computing systems all the way to cloud to on-prem to edge.',\n",
       "    \"And then the final concept is really this industrial deployment now of AI that's causing us to be able to in just about every industry, find growth. And so as you know, our cloud and hyperscalers are growing very, very quickly. However, the vertical part, vertical industries, which is financial services and retail and telco and all of those vertical industries have also grown very, very nicely. And so, in all of those different dimensions, our visibility should be a lot better.\",\n",
       "    \"And then starting a couple of years ago, adding the Mellanox portfolio to our company, we're able to provide a lot more solution-oriented end-to-end platform solutions for companies that don't have the skills and don't have the technical depth to be able to stand up these sophisticated systems.

       "    \"So, it's good to see the team being able to drive – navigate the dynamic supply chain environment, right? You look strong sequential growth in data center in April, here in the July quarter, even with some demand impact from Russia, right? And so, as we think about the second half of the year, cloud spending is strong, and it's actually, I think, accelerating. You're getting ready to ramp H100 later in the year. Mellanox, I think, is getting more supply as you move through the year. And in general, I think previously, you guys were anticipating sequential supply and revenue growth for the business through this entire year.\",\n",
       "    'I understand the uncertainty around gaming, but does the team expect continued sequential growth in data center through the remainder of the year?',\n",

One, for the first time ever, we are prepaying to make sure that we have that supply and those commitments long term.\",\n",
       "    'And additionally, on our purchase obligations, many of them are for long lead time items that are a must for us to procure to make sure that we have the products coming to market. A good percentage of our purchase commitments is for our Data Center business, which you can imagine, are much larger systems, much more complex systems and those things that we are procuring to make sure we can feed the demand both in the upcoming quarters and further. Areas in terms of where we are still a little bit supply constrained are networking. Our demand is quite strong.',\n",

I\\'m wondering if you could help us kind of think about the trajectory of that business over the next couple of quarters? And I think, in the past, you\\'ve said that, that should start to really inflect higher as we move into the second half of the year. Just curious if you could help us think about that piece of the business?',\n",

       "    \"It's designed for a software-defined robotic car or robotic pick and placer or a robotic mover, logistics mover. We've been designed into 35 car and trucks and robo taxi companies and more others.

       "    \"And it's designed as a, if you will, a Data Center on a chip. And it is the first Data Center on a chip that is robotic, processes sensor information, it's safe, it has the ability to be rather resilient as confidential computing. It is designed to be secure, designed to be all those things because these data centers are going to be everywhere. And so O-RAN is really a technological marvels in production.\",\n",
       "    \"We experienced very likely the lowest auto quarter in some time for some time. And the reason for that is because over the next six years-or-so, we have $11 billion and counting of business that we've secured estimated. And so I think it's a fairly safe thing to say now that O-RAN and our autonomous vehicle and robotics business is going to be our next multibillion dollar business. It's on its way surely there.\",\n",
       "    \"The robotics and autonomous systems and autonomous machines, whether they move or not move, but AI systems that are at the physical edge is surely going to be the next major computing segment. It is surely going to be the next major Data Center segment. We've been working in this area, as you know, for a decade. We have a fair amount of expertise in this area.\",\n",
       "    \"And O-RAN is just one example of our work here. We have four pillars to our strategy for autonomous systems. Starting from the data processing and the AI training part of it, to train robotics AIs; second, to simulate robotics AIs, which is omniverse; third, to the memory of the robotics AI otherwise known as mapping; and then finally, the actual robotics application and the robotics processor in the system, and that's where O-RAN goes. But O-RAN is just one of our four pillars of our robotics strategy and the next wave of AI.\",\n",

Accelerating inference growth has been enabled by widespread adoption of our Triton and France server software, which helps customers deliver fast and scalable AI in production. Data center compute demand was driven by continued deployment of our Ampere architecture-based product for fast-growing AI workloads such as natural language processing and deep learning recommendation systems, as well as cloud executing.

When we entered into the transaction in September 2020, we believed that would accelerate Arm's focus on high-performance CPUs and help Arm expand into new markets, benefiting all our customers in the entire ecosystem. Like any combination of pioneers of important technologies, our proposed acquisition spurred questions from regulators worldwide.\",\n",

For over a year, we worked closely with SoftBank and Arm to explain our vision for Arm and reassure regulators that NVIDIA would be a worthy steward of the Arm ecosystem.

       "    'You talked about hyperscale cloud growing more than 2x and enterprise verticals growing strong double digits in the January quarter. Can you kind of speak to the drivers for April and perhaps speak to visibility into the second half of the fiscal year as well in Data Center? Thank you.',\n",
       "    \"I'll start, and I'll turn it over to Jensen. For Q1, our guidance can include an acceleration of Data Center from where we left in terms of Q4. We will have growth across several of our market platforms within Q1, both Data Center, Gaming, and probably a couple of others. But yes, there is expected to be accelerated growth as we move into Q1.\",\n",

       "    'Yes, good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. I guess another question on the data center side. Curious if you can speak to supply constraints on the wafer side and whether that played a role in terms of capping revenues in the January quarter and how you see that becoming less of a headwind for you as you proceed through the year.',\n",
       "    \"Thanks, C.J., for the question. I'll start on the data center supply. As we discussed last quarter and discussed today, we still have some supply constraints across some of our businesses. Networking in the Data Center business has been supply constrained.\",\n",

       "    \"As you know, our data center product line consists of GPUs and mix, Bluefield DPUs, Quantum, and spectrum switches, HGX, if you will, system component, meaning that the entire motherboard or the entire GP board is delivered in combination because it's so complicated. And so, we have products that span a broad reach of use cases for data centers from training of AI models to inferencing at very large scale, to universal GPUs for public cloud, industry-standard servers, community servers for enterprise use, and supercomputing systems that use InfiniBand and quantum switches. And so, the application space is quite broad. We saw demand constrained pretty much across the entire range.\",\n",

We have Grace, and we surely have the follow-ons to Grace, and you could expect us to do a lot of developments around the Arm architecture.\",\n",
       "    \"One of the things that's really evolved nicely over the last couple of years is the success that Arm has seen in hyperscalers and data centers.

So, long as we have a CPU, we could connect NVIDIA's platform to it and accelerate it for artificial intelligence or computer graphics, robotics, and such. And so, we love to see the expansion of CPU footprints, and we're just thrilled that Arm is now growing into robotics and autonomous vehicles and cloud computing and supercomputing and in all these different applications, and we intend to bring the full spectrum of NVIDIA's accelerated computing platform to NVIDIA Arm CPUs.\",\n",
       "    \"Next, we'll go to John Pitzer with Credit Suisse.\",\n",

Just on the inventory purchase obligations, I think this was the fourth quarter in a row where you've seen greater than 30% sequential growth and is the first quarter where that number is now eclipsing kind of your quarterly revenue guidance. And so, I guess I'm trying to figure out, to what extent is this just a reflection of how tight things are across the semi industry? To what extent is this the poker tale of kind of how bullish you are on future demand? And relative to your commentary, that supply starts to get better throughout the year, should we expect that number to start to level off? Or as the mix moves more to data center and more to longer cycle times, more complicated devices should that number continue to grow?\",\n",
       "    'The factors, the drivers that you mentioned in the supply chain, we expanded our supply chain footprint significantly this year to prepare us for both increased supply base and supply availability in each one of the quarters going forward, but also in preparation for some really exciting product launches. As mentioned, Orin ramping into autonomous vehicles is brand new. This is the inflection point of us growing into autonomous vehicles. This is going to be a very large business for us going forward.',\n",

       "    \"But I'm wondering maybe if you can sort of quantify how big the software licensing revenue is today and maybe when you might start to break it out like you did data center, which really got the stock moving in a huge, huge way. Thanks.\",\n",
       "    'Yeah. NVIDIA is a software-driven business. Accelerated computing is a software-driven business. It starts from recognizing what domain of applications we want to accelerate and can accelerate and then building an entire stack from the processor to the system to the system software, the acceleration engines, and potentially even the applications itself, like the software that we were mentioning earlier, NVIDIA DRIVE, NVIDIA AI, and NVIDIA Omniverse.',\n",

But basically, for the cars that we are part of, that we're developing, the end-to-end service, we will get the benefits of the economics of that for the entire life of the fleet of the car. And so, you could imagine, with 10 million cars, with modern car lifetimes of 10 to 20 years, the economics and the market, the installed opportunity is quite high. And so, our business opportunity is based on those factors.\",\n",
       "    'But our software business really, really started several years ago with virtual GPUs, but this year was when we really stepped it up and offered for the very first time NVIDIA AI Enterprise, Omniverse, and DRIVE.

       "    'Thanks for taking my questions. Jensen, in the past, you mentioned about 10% or so adoption rate for AI among your customer base. I was hoping you would quantify where we are in that adoption curve that you tend to differentiate between the adoption differences between your hyperscale and enterprise customers? And then kind of related to that, is there an inorganic element to your growth now that you have over $20 billion of cash on the balance sheet? How are you planning to deploy that to kind of accelerate your growth also?',\n",
       "    \"Yeah. The applications for AI is unquestionably growing, and it's growing incredibly fast. But whether in enterprises and financial services, it could be fraud detection, in cases of consumer pointing businesses, customer service, conversational AI, where people are calling chatbots. But in the future, every website will have a chatbot, every phone number will have a chatbot, whether it's a human in the loop or not human in the loop, we'll have a chatbot.\",\n",

Almost every point of sales, I think, whether it's a fast food or a quick service, businesses are going to have chatbots and AI-based customer service. Retail checkouts will be supported by AI agents. And so, all of this is made possible by a couple of breakthroughs, computer vision, of course, because the agents, the AIs have to make eye contact and recognize your posture and such, recognize speech, understand the context and what is being spoken about and have a reasonable conversation with people so that you could provide good customer service.\",\n",

The combination of RTX with artificial intelligence, which enabled this technology we call DLSS, is able to not only do a ton more computation using our processors but also engage the powerful Tensor for processors that we have in our GPUs to generate images, beautiful images. RTX is being adopted by just every game developer on the planet now. It's being adopted by just about every design tool on the planet now.\",\n",
       "    \"And if not for RTX, Omniverse wouldn't be possible. We wouldn't be able to do physically based path tracing and simulate sensors like radars and LiDARs and ultrasonics and of course, cameras and simulate these cameras physically and still be able to deliver the type of performance that we deliver. And so, RTX was a game-changer for the industry. It reset modern computer graphics.\",\n",

So, in a year where spending is growing 30%. You've got a strong networking upgrade cycle, which is good for your NIC products and just continued overall good attach rates, if the team can unlock more supply, will the networking connectivity business grow in line or faster than the overall Data Center business this year? And then for Jensen, have you driven synergies between Mellanox's leadership in networking connectivity? And for example, leveraging their capabilities for your internally developed NVLink connectivity and switching architectures?\",\n",

Colette, question on the gross margin and to Jensen's point about really creating a software business driven by Omniverse, DRIVE, and Enterprise. When you're kind of contemplating your margin profile over the next couple of years, how do we think about that? Is it really going to be driven by an increasing mix of software as a percentage of your revenue over time? Is there more margin upside on the hardware side in terms of some of your segments? The software opportunity is very exciting, but I'm just curious how that would translate to your kind of more of a longer-term margin profile.\",\n",

       "    'During this call, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures. You can find a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures in our CFO commentary, which is posted on our website.',\n",
       "    'With that, let me turn the call over to Colette.',\n",
       "    'Thanks, Simona. Q3 was an outstanding quarter with revenue of $7.1 billion and year-on-year growth of 50%. We set records for total revenue as well as for Gaming, Data Center and Professional Visualization.',\n",
       "    'Starting with Gaming. Revenue of $3.2 billion was up 5% sequentially and up 42% from a year earlier. Demand was strong across the board. While we continued to increase desktop GPU supply, we believe channel inventories remain low. Laptop GPUs also posted strong year-on-year growth, led by increased demand for high-end RTX laptops. NVIDIA RTX technology is driving our biggest ever refresh cycle with gamers, and continues to expand our base with creators.',\n",
       "    'RTX introduced groundbreaking real-time ray tracing and AI-enabled super resolution capabilities, which are getting adopted at an accelerating pace. More than 200 games and applications now supports NVIDIA RTX, including 125 with NVIDIA DLSS. This quarter alone, 45 new games shipped with DLSS. And NVIDIA Reflex Latency Reducing Technology is in top esports titles, including Valorant, Fortnite, Apex Legends and Overwatch. In addition, the Reflex ecosystem continues to grow with Reflex technology now integrated in almost 50 gaming peripherals.',\n",
       "    'NVIDIA studio for creators keeps expanding. Last month at the Adobe MAX Creativity Conference, Adobe announced two powerful AI features for Adobe Lightroom and the Lightroom Classic, accelerated by NVIDIA RTX GPUs. In addition, several of our partners launched new studio systems, including Microsoft, HP and ASUS. We estimate that a quarter of our installed base has adopted RTX GPUs. Looking ahead, we expect continued upgrades as well as growth from NVIDIA GeForce users, given rapidly expanding RTX support and the growing popularity of gaming, esports, content creation and streaming.',\n",
       "    \"Our GPUs are capable of crypto mining, but we don't have visibility into how much this impacts our overall GPU demand. In Q3, nearly all of our Ampere architecture gaming desktop GPU shipments were lite hash rate to help steer GeForce supply to gamers.\",\n",
       "    'Crypto mining processor revenue was $105 million, which is included in our OEM and other. Our cloud gaming service, GeForce Now, has two major achievements this quarter. First, Electronic Arts brought more of its hit games to the server. And second, we announced the new GeForce Now RTX 3080 membership tier, priced at less than $100 for six months. GeForce Now membership has more than doubled in this last year to over 14 million gamers for streaming content from 30 data centers in more than 80 countries.',\n",
       "    'Moving to Pro Visualization. Q3 revenue of $577 million was up 11% sequentially and up 144% from the year ago quarter. The sequential rise was led by mobile workstations with desktop workstations also growing, as enterprises deployed systems to support hybrid work environment. Building on the strong initial ramp in Q2, Ampere architecture sales continue to grow, leading verticals, including media and entertainment, healthcare, public sector and automotive.',\n",
       "    'Last week, we announced general availability of Omniverse Enterprise, a platform for simulating physically accurate 3D world and digital twins. Initial market reception to Omniverse has been incredible. Professionals at over 700 companies are evaluating the platform, including BMW, Ericsson, Lockheed Martin and Sony Pictures. More than 70,000 individual creators have downloaded Omniverse since the open beta launch in December. There are approximately 40 million 3D designers in the global market.',\n",
       "    'Moving to Automotive. Q3 revenue of $135 million declined 11% sequentially and increased 8% from the year ago quarter. The sequential decline was primarily driven by AI cockpit revenue, which has negatively been impacted by automotive manufacturers supply constraints. We announced that self-driving truck start-up, Kodiak Robotics; auto maker, Lotus; autonomous bus manufacturers, QCraft; and EV start-up, WM Motor, have adopted NVIDIA DRIVE Orin platform for their next-generation vehicles. They join a large and rapidly growing list of companies adopting and developing on NVIDIA DRIVE, including auto OEMs, Tier 1 suppliers, NAVs, trucking companies, mobile taxis and software start-ups.',\n",
       "    'Moving to Data Center. Record revenue of $2.9 billion grew 24% sequentially and 55% from the year ago quarter with record revenue across both hyperscale and vertical industries. Strong growth was led by hyperscale customers, fueled by continued rapid adoption of Ampere architecture Tensor Core GPUs for both internal and external workloads. Hyperscale compute revenue doubled year-on-year, driven by the scale out of natural language processing and recommendator models and cloud computing.',\n",
       "    'Vertical industry growth was also strong, led by consumer Internet and broader cloud providers. For example, Barco Cloud deployed NVIDIA GPUs for its launch of AI services, such as tech analysis, speech recognition, computer vision and anomaly detection.',\n",
       "    'We continue to achieve exceptional growth and influence, which again outpaced our overall Data Center growth. We have transitioned our lineup of infant-focused processes to the Ampere architecture, such as the A30 GPU. We also released the latest version of our Triton Inference Server software, enabling compute-intensive inference workloads such as large language models to scale across multiple GPUs and nodes with real-time performance.',\n",
       "    'Over 25,000 companies worldwide use NVIDIA AI inference. A great new example is Microsoft Teams, which has nearly 250 million monthly active users. It uses NVIDIA AI to convert speech to text real time during video calls in 28 languages in a cost-effective way.',\n",
       "    'We reached three milestones to help drive more mainstream enterprise adoption of NVIDIA AI. First, we announced the general availability of NVIDIA AI Enterprise, a comprehensive software suite with AI tools and frameworks that enables the hundreds of thousands of companies running NVIDIA, running vSphere to virtualize AI workloads on NVIDIA-certified systems.',\n",
       "    \"Second, VMware announced a future update to vSphere with Tanzu that is fully optimized for NVIDIA AI. When it's combined with NVIDIA AI enterprise, enterprises can efficiently manage cloud-native AI development and deployment on main stream data center servers and clouds with existing IT tools.\",\n",
       "    'And third, we expanded our launch cloud program globally with ethernet as our first digital infrastructure partner. NVIDIA LaunchPad is now available in nine locations worldwide, providing enterprises with immediate access to NVIDIA software and infrastructure to help them prototype and test data science and AI workloads. LaunchPad features NVIDIA-certified systems and NVIDIA DGX systems running the entire NVIDIA AI software stack.',\n",
       "    'In networking, revenue was impacted as demand outstripped supply. We saw momentum toward higher speed and new generation products, including ConnectX-5 and 6. We announced the NVIDIA Quantum-2 400 gigabit per second end-to-end networking platform, consisting of the Quantum-2 switch the ConnectX-7 network adapter and the BlueField-3 DPU.',\n",
       "    'The NVIDIA Quantum-two, which is available from a wide range of building infrastructure and system vendors around the world. Earlier this week, the latest top 500 list of supercomputers showed continued momentum for our full stack computing approach.',\n",
       "    \"NVIDIA's technologies accelerate over 70% of the systems Muslims on the including over 90% of all new systems and 23 of the top 25 most energy-efficient systems.\",\n",
       "    \"Turning to GTC. Last week we hosted our GPU Technology Conference, which had over 270,000 registered attendees. Jensen's keynote has been viewed 25 million times over the past eight days. While our Spring GTC is focused on new chips and systems, this edition focused on software, demonstrating our full computing stack. Let me cover some of the highlights.\",\n",
       "    'Our vision for Omniverse came to life at GTC. We significantly expanded this ecosystem and announced new capabilities. Omniverse replication is an engine for producing data to train robots, replicating augment real-world data with massive, diverse and physically accurate synthetic data sets to both accelerate development of high-quality, high-performance AI across computing demand. NVIDIA Omniverse Avatar is our platform for generating interactive AI avatars. It connects several core NVIDIA SDKs including switch AI, computer vision, natural language understanding, recommendation engines and simulation. Applications including automated customer service, virtual collaboration and content solution. Replicator ad avatar joined several other announced features and capabilities for Omniverse, including AI, AR, VR and simulation-based technologies.',\n",
       "    'We introduced 65 new and updated software development page, bringing our total to more than 150 serving industries from gaming and design to AI, cybersecurity, 5G and robotics. One of the STKs is our first four licensed AI model, NVIDIA Riva, for building conversational AI applications. Companies using Riva during the open beta include RingCentral for video conference live captioning and Pig An for customer service chatbots. NVIDIA Riva Enterprise will be commercially available early next year, for launch.',\n",
       "    \"We introduced the NVIDIA's NeMo Megatron optimized for training large language models on NVIDIA DGX SuperPOD infrastructure. This combination brings together production-ready, enterprise-grade hardware and software in both vertical industries, develop language and industry-specific dropbox, personal systems, content generation and summarization. Early adopters include SiDi, JD.com and VinBrain. We unveiled BlueField DOCA 1.2, the latest version of our GPU programming lender with new cybersecurity capabilities. DOCA is to our GPUs as CUDA is to our GPUs. It enables developers to build applications and services on top of our BlueFiled DOCAs. Our new capabilities make BlueField the ideal platform for the industry to build their own zero trust security platforms. The leading cybersecurity companies are working with us to provision their next-generation firewall service on BlueField, including Checkpoint, Juniper, Borgne, F5, Palo Alto Networks and VMware. And we released Clara Holoscan, a edge AI computing platform for medical instruments to improve decision-making tools in areas such as robo-assisted surgery, interventional radiology and radiation therapy planning.\",\n",
       "    \"Other new or expanded SDKs or libraries unveiled at GTC include ReOpt for AI optimized logistics Quantum for quantum computing, Morpheus for cybersecurity, Modulus for physical-based machine learning and Crunet Numeric, a data center scale mass library to bring accelerated computing to the large and growing Python ecosystem. All in, NVIDIA's computing platform continues to expand as a broadening set of SDK enable more and more GPU-accelerated applications and industry use cases.\",\n",
       "    'CUDA has been downloaded 30 million times, and our developer ecosystem is now nearing 3 million strong. The applications they develop on top of our SDK and the cloud to edge computing platform are helping to transform multitrillion dollar industries from healthcare to transportation to mental services, manufacturing, logistics and virtual.',\n",
       "    \"In Automotive, we announced NVIDIA DRIVE Concierge and DRIVE Chauffeur, AI software platforms that enhance a vehicle's performance, features and safety. Live Concierge build on Omniverse Avatar functioned as an AI-based in-vehicle person-assistance, but enables automatic parking, summoning capabilities. It also enhanced safety by monitoring the driver throughout the duration of the drive.\",\n",
       "    'DRIVE Chauffeur offers autonomous capabilities, relieving the driver of constantly having to control the car. It will also perform address to address driving when combined with DRIVE Hyperion 8 platform.',\n",
       "    \"For robotics, we announced Jetson AGX Orin, the world's smallest, most powerful and energy-efficient AI supercomputer for robotics, autonomous mission and embedded computing at the Edge. Built on our Ampere architecture, Jetson AGX Orin provides 6 times the processing power of its predecessor and delivers 200 trillion operations per second, similar to a GPU-enabled server that fits into the palm of your hand. Jetson AGX Orin will be available in the first quarter of calendar 2022.\",\n",
       "    \"Finally, we revealed plans to build Earth-2, the world's most powerful AI supercomputer dedicated to confronting climate change. The system would be the climate change counterpart to Cambridge-1, the U.K.'s most powerful AI supercomputer that we built for corporate research. Earth-2 furnishes all the technologies we've invented up to this moment.\",\n",
       "    \"Let me discuss Arm. I'll provide you a brief update on our proposed acquisition of Arm. Arm with NVIDIA is a great opportunity for the industry and customers with NVIDIA's scale, capabilities and robust understanding of data center computing, acceleration and AI. We assessed Arm in expanding their reach into data center, IOT and PCs and advanced Arm's IP for decades to come. The combination of our companies can enhance competition in the industry as we work together on further building the world of AI.\",\n",
       "    'Moving to the rest of the P&L. GAAP gross margin for the third quarter was up 260 basis points from a year earlier, primarily due to higher end mix within desktop, notebook, GeForce GPUs. The year-on-year increase also benefited from a reduced impact of acquisition-related costs. GAAP gross margin was up 40 basis points sequentially, driven by growth in our Data Center Ampere architecture products, which is particularly offset by mix in gaming. Non-gaming gross margin was up 150 basis points from a year earlier and up 30 basis points sequentially.',\n",
       "    'Q3 GAAP EPS was $0.97, 83% from a year earlier. Non-GAAP EPS was $1.17, up 60% from a year ago, adjusting for our stock split. Q3 cash flow from operations was $1.5 billion, up from $1.3 billion a year earlier and down from $2.7 billion in the prior quarter. The year-on-year increase primarily reflects higher operating income, particularly offset by prepayment for long-term supply agreement.',\n",
       "    'Let me turn to the outlook for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022. We expect sequential growth to be driven by Data Center and Gaming, more than offsetting a decline in CMP. Revenue is expected to be $7.4 billion plus or minus 2%. GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 65.3% and 67%, respectively, plus or minus 50 basis points. GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $2.02 billion and $1.43 billion, respectively. GAAP and non-GAAP other income and expenses are both expected to be an expense of approximately $60 million, excluding gains and losses on non-affiliated investments. GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates are both expected to be 11%, plus or minus 1% excluding discrete items. Capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $250 million to $275 million.',\n",
       "    'Further financial details are included in the CFO commentary. Other information is also available on our IR website.',\n",
       "    'In closing, let me highlight upcoming events for the financial community. We will be attending the Credit Suisse 25th Annual Technology Conference in person on November 30th. We will also be at the Wells Fargo Fifth Annual TMT Summit virtually on December 1st, the UBS Global TMT Virtual Conference on December 6th, and the Deutsche Bank Virtual Auto Tech Conference on December 9th. Our earnings call to discuss our fourth quarter and fiscal year 2022 results is scheduled for Wednesday, February 16.',\n",
       "    'With that, we will now open the call for questions. Operator, will you please poll for the questions.',\n",
       "    'Questions and Answers:',\n",
       "    '[Operator Instructions] For our first question, we have Aaron Rakers from Wells Fargo. Aaron, your line is open.',\n",
       "    \"Yes. Thanks for taking the question and congratulations on the results. I guess, I wanted to ask about Omniverse. Obviously, a lot of excitement around that. I guess the simple question is, Jensen, how do you define success in Omniverse as we look out over the next, let's call it, 12 months and how do we think about the subscription license opportunity for Omniverse. I know you've talked about $40 million total 3D designers, I think that actually doubled what you talked about back in August. So I'm just curious of how we at finance line should probably think about that opportunity materializing?\",\n",
       "    \"Near term also, it should be revenues and Omniverse has real immediate applications as I demonstrated at the keynote and I'll highlight a few of them right now. One of them, of course, is that it serves as a way to connect 3D and digital design world. Think of Adobe as a world, think of the Autodesk as a world, think of Revit as a world. These are design world in the sense that people are doing things in it, they are creating things in it and they have to run database.\",\n",
       "    \"We made it possible for these worlds to be connected for the very first time and for it to be shared like in cloud documents. That's not been possible ever before and we can now share work with each other, you can see each other's work, you can collaborate. And so in the world of remote working, Ominverse's collaboration capability is going to be really appreciated and that should happen right away. We would like to see that happen in very near term. And that drives of course, more PC sales, more GPU sales, more workstation sales, more server sales.\",\n",
       "    \"The second use case is digital twins. And we show in these following examples of how several companies using Omniverse to create a digital twin of a city so that they could optimize radio placements and radio energy used for beamforming. You saw BMW using it for their factories. You're going to see people using it for warehouse, logistics warehouse to plan and to optimize their warehouses and deploying the robots. And so digital twin applications are absolutely immediate.\",\n",
       "    \"We built Omniverse Avatars to make it easy for people to integrate some amazing technology for computer vision, for speech recognition, natural language understanding, gesture recognition, facial animation and speech synthesis, recommender systems, all of that integrated into one system and running in real time. That Avatar system is essentially a robotic system and the way that you use that is, for example, with $25 million or so retail stores, restaurant, places like airports and train stations, office buildings and such, where you're going to have intelligent Avatars doing a lot of assistance. They might be doing check out, they might be doing check in, they might be doing customer support and all of that can be done with Avatars, as I've demonstrated.\",\n",
       "    'So the virtual robotics application, digital buys of Avatars, it is going to be likely the largest robotics opportunity. So if you look at our licensing model, the way it basically works is that inside Omniverse is one of the main users and the main users could be one of the 20 million creators or 20 million designers and the 40 million creators and designers around the world and they share Omniverse, each one of the main users would be a $1,000 per user per year.',\n",
       "    \"But don't forget that intelligent use or intelligent users that have been connected through Omniverse will likely be much larger as digital buyers than humans. So I mentioned 40 million, but there are 100 million cars. And these 100 million cars will have the capability to have something like in Omniverse Avatar and so those 100 million cars could be $1,000 per car per year. And in the case of the 25 million or so places where you would have a digital avatar as customer support or check out smart retail or smart warehouses or smart whatever it is, those avatars also would each individually be a new account and so they would be $1,000 per Avatar per year. And so those are the immediate tangible opportunities for us and I demonstrate the applications in related keynotes. And then of course behind all of that, call it a couple of hundred million digital agents, intelligent agents, some of them humans, some of them robots, some of them Avatars adds $1,000 per agent per year. Behind it are, NVIDIA GPUs in PC, NVIDIA GPU in cloud, and NVIDIA GPUs in Omniverse servers. And my guess would be that the hardware part of it is probably going to be about half and then the licensing part of it is probably about half of the time. So this is really going to be one of the largest graphics opportunities that we've ever seen.\",\n",
       "    \"And the reason why it's taken so long for us to manifest is because it requires three fundamental technologies to come together, I guess four fundamentals technologies to come together. First of all, it's video graphic; second is physics simulation, because we're talking about things in world that has to be believable, so it has to obey the laws of physics; and then third is artificial intelligence, as I demonstrated and illustrated just now. And all of it runs on top of an Omniverse computer that has to do not just AI, not just physics, not just computer graphics, but all of it.\",\n",
       "    \"And so long term why people are so excited about it is, at the highest level what it basically means is that that long-term when we engage in that, which is largely 2D today, long-term every query would be 3D and instead of just querying information, we would query and interact with people and Avatars and things and places and all of these things are in 3D. So hopefully one of these days that we will probably realize it as fast as we can every transaction that goes on to internet touches a GPU and today that's a very small percentage, but hopefully one of these days it will be a bit of a high percentage. So I hope that's helpful.\",\n",
       "    'For our next question, we have Mark Lipacis from Jefferies. Mark, your line is open.',\n",
       "    \"And so it takes a fair amount of expertise and that's why we're saying that over the years, over the course of 30 years we have become a full-stack company, because we've been trying to solve this problem practically through decades. And so that's one. But the benefit, once you have the ability, then you can open new markets and we played a really large role in democratizing artificial intelligence and making it possible for anybody to be able to do it.\",\n",
       "    \"Our greatest contribution is I hope when it's all said and done that we democratized scientific computing, so that researchers and scientists, computer scientists, data scientists, scientists of all kinds were able to get access to this incredibly powerful tool that we call computers to do advance research. And so every single year we're coming up with new stacks and we got a whole bunch of stacks we are working on and many of them are working on in plain sight, so that you see it coming, you just have to connect it together.\",\n",
       "    \"And so anyway, I think what you highlight is, one, accelerated computing is a full-stack challenge. Two, it takes software to open new markets. Chips can't open new markets. If you build another chip, you can steal somebody's share, but you can't open new market and it takes software to open new market. NVIDIA switch with software, and that's one of the reasons why we could integrate such large market opportunities.\",\n",
       "    \"And then last with respect to Omniverse, I believe it's a near-term opportunity that we've be working on for some three, four, five years.\",\n",
       "    'For our next question, we have C.J. Muse from Evercore ISI. C.J., your line is open.',\n",
       "    \"Yes. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. And I guess not an Omniverse question, but I guess, Jensen, I'd like your commitment that you will not use Omniverse to target the sell-side research industry.\",\n",
       "    \"As my real question, can you speak to your Data Center visibility into 2022 and beyond? And within this outlook, can you talk to traditional cloud versus industry verticals and then perhaps emerging opportunities like Omniverse and others? Would love to get a sense of kind of what you're seeing today. And then as part of that, how you're planning to secure foundry and other supply to support that growth? Thank you.\",\n",
       "    \"Thank you, C.J. First of all, we have secured guaranteed supply, very large amounts of it, quite a spectacular amount of it from the world's leading foundry in substrate and packaging and testing certain companies, the integral part of our supply chain. And so we have done that and feel very good about our supply situation, particularly starting in the second half of this year and going forward. I think this whole last year was a wakeup call for everybody to be much more mindful about not taking the supply chain for granted and we were fortunate to have such good partners, but nonetheless we've secured our future.\",\n",
       "    \"With respect to Data Center, about half of our Data Center business comes from the cloud and cloud service providers and the other half comes from enterprise, what we call enterprise companies and they're in all kinds of industries. And about 1% of it comes from supercomputing centers, because so 50% or so cloud, 50% or so enterprise and 1% supercomputing centers.\",\n",
       "    'So back to your original question, I think next year is going to be quite a good year for Data Center. Customers are very mindful of securing their supply for their scale out and so we have a fair amount of visibility and more visibility commonly than ever at Data Center, but in addition to that, Triton is just in adoption everywhere.',\n",
       "    \"And then, finally, our brand-new workloads, which is built on top of AI and graphics and simulation, which is Omniverse, and we saw the examples that I gave, these are real companies doing real work and one of the areas that has severe shortages around the world is customer support, just genuine severe shortages all over the world, and we think the answer is Omniverse Avatar. And it runs in Data Center, you could easily adapt Omniverse Avatar to do drive-thrus or retail check out or customer service, and I demonstrated that with Tokyo, a parking kiosk. You can use it for a tele-operated customer service and we've demonstrated that with Maxine and we demonstrated how you could use it even for video conferencing. And then lastly, we demonstrated how we could use Omniverse Avatar for robotics, for example, to create a continues work what we call DRIVE Concierge where the car is turned into intelligent customer support, intelligent agent.\",\n",
       "    'I think Omniverse Avatar is going to be a really exciting driver for enterprise this next year. And so next year is going to be a pretty terrific year for Data Center.',\n",
       "    'For our next question, we have Stacy Rasgon from Bernstein Research. Stacy, your line is open.',\n",
       "    \"Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to ask two of them on Data Center, both near term and then maybe a little longer term. On the near-term, Colette, you suggested guidance in the Q4 be driven by Data Center and gaming and you mentioned data center first. Does that mean that it's bigger? If you could just help us like parse the contribution of each into Q4?\",\n",
       "    \"And then in the next year, given the commentary for the last question, again it sounds like you've got like a very strong outlook for Data Center both from hyperscale and enterprise. If I look at sort of the implied guidance you gave, Data Center for you is probably likely to grow 50% year-over-year in this fiscal year. Would it be crazy to think given all the drivers that it could grow by a similar amount next year as well? Like, how should we be thinking about that given all of the drivers that you've been laying out?\",\n",
       "    \"Okay. Thanks, Stacy, for the question. Let's first focus in terms of our guidance for Q4. Our statements that we made were, yes, about driven by revenue growth from Data Center and Gaming sequentially. We can probably expect our Data Center to grow faster than our Gaming, probably both in terms of percentage wise and in absolute dollars. We also expect our CMP product to decline quarter-on-quarter to very negligible levels in Q4. So I hope that gives you a color on Q4.\",\n",
       "    \"Now in terms of next year, we'll certainly turn the corner into the new fiscal year. We certainly provide guidance one quarter out. We've given you some great discussions here about the opportunities in front of us, opportunities with the hyperscales, the opportunities with the verticals. Omniverse is a full stack opportunity in front of us.\",\n",
       "    \"We are securing supply for next year, not just for the current year and Q4, to allow us to really grow into so much of this opportunity going forward. But at this time, we're going to wait until next year to provide guidance.\",\n",
       "    \"Got it. That's helpful. I appreciate it. Thank you\",\n",
       "    'For the next question we have Vivek Arya from BofA Securities. Vivek, your line is open.',\n",
       "    \"Thanks for taking my question. Actually I had two quick ones. And so, Colette, you suggested the inventory purchase and supply agreements are up, I think, almost 68% year-on-year. Does that provide some directional correlation with how you are preparing for growth over the next 12 to 24 months? So that's one question. And then the bigger question, Jensen, that I have for you is, where are we in the AI adoption cycle? What percentage of servers are accelerated in hyperscale and vertical industry today and where can those ratios get to?\",\n",
       "    \"Thanks for the question. So let's first start in terms of supply or supply purchase agreement. You have noted that we are discussing that we have made payments toward some of those commitments. Not only are we procuring for what we need in the quarter, what we need next year and again we are planning for growth next year, so we have been planning that supply purchases, we are also doing long-term supply purchases. These are areas of capacity agreements and/or many of our different suppliers.\",\n",
       "    'We made a payment within this quarter of approximately $1.6 billion out of total long-term capacity agreement of about $3.4 billion. So we still have more payments to make and we were likely continue to be purchasing longer term to support our growth that we are planning for many years to come.',\n",
       "    \"Every single server will be GPU accelerated some day. Today of all the clouds and all the enterprise, less than 10%. That kind of give you a sense of where you are. In terms of the workloads, it is also consistent with that in the sense that that a lot of the workloads still only run on CPUs, which is the reason why in order for us to grow, we have to be a full stack company and we have to go find applications, we now have to find plenty of it, focus on the application that require acceleration or benefits tremendously from acceleration that if they were to get a million X speed up, which sounds insane but it's not. Mathematically I can prove it to you and historically I can even demonstrate it to you that in many areas we have seen million X speed up and has completely revolutionized those industries, computer graphics is of course one of them. Omniverse would not be possible without it.\",\n",
       "    \"And so in each one of these cases we have performed, we have to focus our resources to go and accelerate those applications and that translates to growth. Until then, they run on GPUs. And we look at a lot of today speech synthesis and speech recognition system, it still uses fairly traditional or mixture of traditional and deep learning approaches for speech AI. NVIDIA Riva is the world's first, I believe, that is end to end deep neural network. And we've worked with many companies in helping them advance there, so that they could move their clouds to our neural-based approaches. But that's one of the reasons why we do it, so that we could provide the reference, but we can also license it to enterprises around the world, so that they could advance it for their own use cases. And so one application after another we have to get it accelerated, one domain after another we have to get it accelerated.\",\n",
       "    \"One of the ones that we're excited about and something that we've been working on for so long is EDA, even our own industry, Electronic Design Automation, for the very first time we announced the EDA using GPU accelerated computing, whether it's because of the artificial intelligence capability, because EDA is very large combinatorial optimization program and using artificial intelligence you could really improve the design quality and design time.\",\n",
       "    \"So we're seeing from all the major game vendors, from chip design to simulation to PCB design and optimization, design synthesis, moving toward artificial intelligence and GPU acceleration in a very significant. And then we see that with a mechanical CAD and traditional CAD application now also jumping on to GPU acceleration is getting very significant speed ups. And so I'm super excited about the work that we're doing in each one of these domains. Because every time you do it, you open up brand new market and customers that never used NVIDIA GPUs now can, because ultimately people don't buy chips, it cannot solve problems. Without a full stack, without software expertise, you can't really commence the enabling technology, what the chip provide and ultimately solve the customers' problems.\",\n",

Are there any margin headwinds maybe on the wafer pricing side that we should sort of think about normalizing out, because gross margin is pretty flat between fiscal Q2 and fiscal Q4. But I imagine that's kind of masking a strong underlying margin growth, especially as Data Center has been actually driving that growth. So I'm wondering if maybe there are some underlying factors that are sort of gating gross margin? Thanks.\",\n",
       "    \"Yes. So we have always been working on our gross margin and being able to absorb a lot of the cost changes along the way, architecture-to-architecture really. So that's always based into our gross margin. Our gross margins right now are largely stable. Our incremental revenue, for example, what we're expecting next quarter will likely align to our current gross margin levels that we finished in terms of Q3. Our largest driver always continues to be mix. We have a lot of different mix that has driven related to the high-end AI and RTX solutions, for example, and the software that is embedded in solutions have allowed us to increase our gross margin.\",\n",

I think near-term, you mentioned the possibility of accelerating data center growth from the 35% rate. I was hoping if you could give us some more color around that confidence and visibility? And then, longer term, Jensen, we have seen a lot of announcements from NVIDIA about your enterprise software opportunity. I honestly don't know how to model that. It sounds very promising, but how should be model it? What problem are you trying to solve? Is it cannibalizing demand you might have otherwise seen from your public cloud customers or is this incremental to grow? So just any guidance or any just insights into how to think about NVIDIA's enterprise software opportunity longer-term? Thank you.\",\n",
       "    'The second is the introduction of Tensor RT, which is our optimizing compiler that makes it possible for us to compile and optimize any AI application to our GPUs.

       "    \"Yeah. So let me start and I'll let Jensen add a bit, Stacy, to your question. Just for providing the guidance for Q3 of $6.8 billion in revenue. Now, excluding CMP, we expect our revenue to grow over $500 million sequentially. Our lion's share about sequential revenue increase will be coming from data center. We do expect Gaming to be up slightly on a sequential basis, but remember, we are still supply constrained. Automotive and Pro Vis are also expected to be up slightly quarter-over-quarter. And from a CMP perspective, we'll probably just have minimal amounts in Q3. So, our Q3 results don't have seasonality with some for gaming and are really about the supply that we believe we can have for Q3.\",\n",

For my question, I wanted to follow-on, on Stacy's question about supply. And Colette maybe you could give us a little bit of commentary around supply constraints in gaming in the different tiers or price tiers of your gaming cards. I'm just trying to get a better understanding as to how you guys are managing supply across the different price tiers? And I guess it translates into a question of, are the gaming ASPs that we're seeing in the October quarter guidance, are those what you would call sustainable going forward or do you feel like that mix may change as supply comes online? Thank you.\",\n",
       "    \"So, I'll start here. Thanks for the question on our overall mix as we go forward. First, our supply constraint in our gaming business is largely attributed to our desktop and notebook. That can mean a lot of different things from our components that are necessary to build so many of our products. But our mix is really important. Our mix, as we have also seen, many of our gamers very interested in our higher-end higher performance products. We will continue to see that as a driver of that overall lifts both our revenue and can lift our overall gross margins. So, there's quite a few different pieces into our supply that we have to think about, but we are going to try and make the best solutions for gamers at this time.\",\n",
       "    \"Yeah. Thank you. Good afternoon. I guess, a follow-up question on the supply constraints. When do you think that they'll ease and how should we think about gaming into the January quarter B2B typical seasonality, given I would assume you would continue to be supply constraint?

       "    \"Okay. We're supply constrained in graphics, and we're supply constrained in graphics while we're delivering record revenues in graphics. Cloud gaming is growing. Cloud graphics is growing. RTX made it possible for us to address the design in accretive workstations. Historically, the rendering of ray tracing and photo realistic images has largely been done on CPUs and for the very first time, you could actually accelerate it with NVIDIA GPUs and RTX GPUs. And so the workstation market is really doing well. The backdrop of that of course is that people are building offices in their homes. And for many of the designers and creators around the world, some 20 million of them, they have to create, they have to build a workstation or an office at home, as well as the one that work, because we're now working with the new one.\",\n",

       "    'Good afternoon. And congratulations on the strong results outlook and execution. The Mellanox networking franchise, this has been a really strong and synergistic addition to the NVIDIA Compute portfolio. I think, kind of near-to mid-term, the team is benefiting from the transition to 200 and 400 gig networking connectivity in cloud and hyperscale. And then, I think, in addition to that, you guys are getting some good traction with the BlueField SmartNIC products. Can you just give us a sense on how the business is trending year-over-year? And do you expect continued quarter-over-quarter networking momentum into the second half of this year, especially as the cloud and hyperscalers are going to a server and capex spending cycle?',\n",
       "    \"And so, the ease of scale out that this aggregated computing provides also puts enormous pressure on the networking. And at the Mellanox, the world's lowest latency and a high bandwidth and performance networking on the planet. And so, the ability to scale out and the ability to provisioning disaggregated applications, it was really much, much better work on Mellanox networking. So that's number one.\",\n",
       "    \"And so, you will see supercomputers that are built out of Mellanox, InfiniBand and the high-speed networking, along with NVIDIA GPU computing in more and more cloud service providers. You're also seeing it in enterprises, for used in the discovery of DRIVE. There's a digital biology revolution going on as the competition is stable. The large scale computing that we're able to do now in AI, better understand biology and better understand chemistry and bringing both of those deals into the field of information sciences. And so, you're seeing in March, [Technical Issues] in enterprises around the world as well. And so, the second dynamic has to do with our incredibly great networking, InfiniBand networking side as well, de facto standard in high performance computing.\",\n",
       "    \"And the third dynamic is around data center storing software. In order to orchestrate and run a data center with just a few people, essentially when the entire data centers, hundreds of thousands of servers as it is just one computer in front of you, that entire data center is software defined. And there's not a software that goes into that software-defined data center run on today's GPUs. It's the networking stack, the storage stack and now which has zero trust, the securities stack. All of that is putting enormous pressure on the available computing capacity for applications, which is ultimately what data centers are designed to do.\",\n",
       "    \"And so, the software defined data center needs to have a place to Triton infrastructure software and it's downloaded, offloaded, accelerated and very importantly to isolate it from the application plan, so that intruders cannot jump into the operating system, if you will, of your data center, the fabric of your data center. And so, the answer to that is BlueField. The ability to offload, accelerate and isolate the data center software infrastructure and to hurry up all of the CTOs to run what they're supposed to run, which is the application. Just about every data center in the world is moving towards a zero trust model and BlueField is just incredibly well positioned. So these three dynamics, disaggregated computing is really strong with fast networking, every company needing high performance computing, and lastly, software defined data centers following zero trust. And so, these are really important dynamics. And I appreciate the opportunity to tell you all that. And this is to tell how super exciting about the prospects of NVIDIA's networking business and the importance that they have in building modern data centers.\",\n",
       "    'Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers of Wells Fargo. Your line is open.',\n",
       "    \"Yeah. Thanks for taking the question. I think you hit a lot of my questions around the data center in that last one. So maybe I'll just ask kind of on a P&L basis. One of the things that I see in the results and more importantly the guidance, you're now, Colette, guiding over 67% gross margin potentially. I'm curious as we move forward, how do you think about the incremental operating gross margin upside still from here and how you're thinking about the operating margin leverage for the company from here through the P&L. Thank you.\",\n",
       "    \"Yeah. Colette, let me take that and if you could just follow-up with the details, that would be great. I think, at the highest level, I really appreciate the question. At the highest level, the important thing to realize is that artificial intelligence is the single greatest technology force that the computer industry has ever seen and potentially the world has ever seen. The automation opportunities which drives productivity, which translates directly to the cost savings of the companies is enormous. And it opens up opportunities for technology and computing companies like it's never happened before.\",\n",
       "    'Thank you. The next question comes from the line of John Pitzer of Credit Suisse. Your line is open.',\n",
       "    \"Yeah. Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for letting me ask a question. Apologize for the short-term nature of the question, but it's what I get asked most frequently. I kind of want to return to the impact of crypto with the potential impact of crypto. Colette, is there any way to kind of gauge the effectiveness of the low hash rate GeForce? Why only 80% and not 100%? And how confident are you that the CMP business being down is a reflection of crypto going off versus perhaps LHR being not that effective? And I bring it up because there's a lot of blogs out there that would suggest that as much as you guys are trying to limit the ability of miners to use GeForce, there are some work-arounds.\",\n",
       "    'Yeah. Go ahead.',\n",
       "    \"Yeah. Let me start there and answer a couple of the questions about our strategy that we've put in place in this last couple of quarters. As you recall, what we put in place was the low hash rate cards as well as putting in the CMP cards. The low hash rate cards were to provide for more supply for our GeForce gamers that are out there. We articulated one of the metrics that we were looking is what percentage of those cards in Ampere we were able to sell with low hash cards. Almost all of our cards in Ampere are low hash rates, but also we are selling other types of cards as well. But at this time as we move forward, we're much higher than 80% but just at the end of this last quarter, we were approximately 80%. So, yes, that is moving up. So, the strategy is in place and will continue as we move into Q3.\",\n",
       "    \"I'll move it to Jensen here to see if he can discuss further.\",\n",
       "    \"There's the question about the strategy of how we're steering GeForce supply to gamers. We moved incredibly fast with CMP and our LHR settings for GeForce. And our entire strategy is about steering GeForce supplies to gamers. And we have every reason to believe that because of the DRIVE team, which is really a measure of gamers, the rate of growth of our team adoption of Ampere GPUs, there's some evidence that we are successful. But there are several reasons why it's different this time. The first reason of course is the LHR which is new and the speed at which we responded with CMP GeForce applied to gamers.\",\n",
       "    \"The third reason is that our demand is strong in our channel. And you can see that everyday with shortage of supply as quickly as we're shipping it. It's [Indecipherable] all over the world.\",\n",
       "    \"And then lastly, we have more growth drivers today because of RTX than ever. And we have the biggest wave of NVIDIA laptops. Just laptops is our fastest growing segment of computing and we have the largest wave of laptops coming. The demand for RTX in workstations, whereas previously the workstation market was a slow-growing market, it's now a fast growing market and has achieved records. And after more than a decade of working on cloud graphics, cloud graphics is in great demand. And so, all of these segments are seeing high demand while we continue to be supply limited. And so, I think the situations are very different and RTX is making a huge difference.\",\n",
       "    'Thank you. We have the next question come from the line of Chris Caso of Raymond James. Your line is now open.',\n",
       "    \"Yes. Thank you. Good evening. My question is about the split between the hyperscale and the vertical customers in the data center business and the trends you're seeing in each. I think, in your prepared remarks you said both would be up in the October quarter. But I'm interested to see if you're seeing any differing trends there, particularly in the vertical business as perhaps business conditions normalize and companies return to the office and they adjust their spending plans accordingly.\",\n",
       "    \"Yeah. So let me start out with the question and I'll let Jensen answer the tail. So far, with our data center business, with our Q2 results, our vertical industries are still quite a strong percentage. Essentially 50% of our data center business is going to our vertical industries. Our hyperscales make up the other portion of that slightly below the 50%. And then we also have our supercomputing business with a very small percentage but doing quite well. As we move into Q3 as we discussed, we will see an acceleration of both our vertical industries and our hyperscalers as we move into Q3.\",\n",
       "    \"With that backdrop, we'll see if Jensen has additional commentary.\",\n",
       "    \"There's a fundamental difference in hyperscale use of HPC or AI versus the industrial use of HPC and AI. In the world of hyperscalers and Internet service providers, they're making recommendations on movies and songs and articles and search results and so on and so forth. And the difference in the improvement in hyper speed, the deep learning and artificial intelligence large recommender systems can provide us, they're really working for them.\",\n",
       "    \"In the world of industry, the reason why artificial intelligence is transformative, recognizing that most of the things I just mentioned earlier, it's not really dynamic in the world's largest industries, whether it's healthcare or logistics or transportation and retail, the vast majority of the reasons why in some of the physical sciences industries, whether it's energy or transportation and such or healthcare, the simulation of physics, the simulation of the world was not achievable using traditional first principle simulation approaches. But artificial intelligence or data-driven approaches has completely shaken that up and put it on its head.\",\n",
       "    \"And just as we made it possible using artificial intelligence, the realization of real-time ray tracing in every field of science, whether it's climate simulation, energy discovery, drug discovery, we're starting to see the industry recognizing that the fusion of the first-principle simulation and data-driven artificial intelligence approaches is going to get a giant leap up. And that is a second dynamic.\",\n",
       "    'The other dynamic for industry is for the very first time, they could deploy AI model out to the edge to do a better job with agriculture, to do a better job with asset protection and warehouses, to do a better job with automating retail. AI is going to make it possible for all of these types of automation to finally be realized. And so, the dynamics are all very different.',\n",
       "    \"That last one has to do with Edge AI, which was just made possible by putting AI right at the point of data and right at the point of action because you need to be low cost, you need to be high performance and instantly responsive. And you can't afford to stream all of the data to the cloud all the time. And so each one of them has a slightly different [Technical Issues].\",\n",

       "    \"Great. Thanks so much for taking my question. Jensen, I'm wondering if you can talk for a moment about Omniverse. This looks like a really cool technology, but I tend to get very few questions from investors about it. But it looks to me like this could be potentially very meaningful technology for you longer-term. Can you explain perhaps what capabilities and what markets this is going after? It looks like perhaps this is going to position you very well in augmented and virtual reality, but maybe it's a sort of different market or group of markets, it's a bit confusing to us. So, if you could maybe help us understand it, it would be really appreciated. Thank you.\",\n",
       "    \"And we'll have to enjoy a lot of our time in the future in Omniverse and the metaverse. And we'll do a lot of our work there and we'll have a lot of robots there doing a lot of our work on our behalf. And we wake up in morning as they show us results. So, Omniverse to us is an extension of our AI strategy. It's an extension of our high-performance computing strategy. And it makes it possible for companies and industries to be able to create digital tools that simulates the physical version before they deploy it and while they operate it.\",\n",

       "    'Q1 was exceptionally strong with revenue of $5.66 billion and year-on-year growth accelerating to 84%. We set a record in total revenue in Gaming, Data Center and Professional Visualization, driven by our best ever product lineups and structural tailwinds across our businesses.',\n",
       "    'Starting with Gaming, revenue of $2.8 billion was up 11% sequentially and up 106% from a year earlier. This is the third consecutive quarter of accelerating year-on-year growth beginning with the fall launch of our GeForce RTX 30 Series GPUs. Based on the Ampere GPU architecture, the 30 series has been our most successful launch ever, driving incredible demand and setting records for both desktop and laptop GPU sales. Channel inventories are still leading and we expect to remain supply constrained into the second half of the year.',\n",
       "    'With our Ampere GPU architecture now ramping across the stack in both desktops and laptops, we expect the RTX upgrade cycle to kick into high gear, as the vast majority of our GPU installed base needs to upgrade. Now Laptops continue to drive strong growth this quarter as we started ramping the Ampere GPU architecture across our lineup. Earlier this month, all major PC OEMs launched GeForce RTX 30 Series laptops based on the 3080, 3070 and 3060, as part of their spring refresh. In addition, mainstream versions based on the 3050 and 3050 Ti will be available this summer just in time for back-to-school starting at price points as low as $799.',\n",
       "    \"This is the largest ever wave of GeForce gaming laptops, over 140 in total as OEMs address the rising demand for gamers, creators and students for NVIDIA's powered laptops. The RTX 30 Series delivers our biggest generational ray tracing [Phonetic] performance ever. It also features our second-generation ray tracing technology and frame rate boosting, AI-powered DLSS. The RTX is a reset for graphics with over 60 accelerated games. This quarter, we added many more, including Call of Duty, Modern Warfare, Crysis Remastered and Outriders. We also announced that DLSS is now available in Unreal Engine 4 and soon in the Unity game engine, enabling game developers to accelerate frame rates with minimal effort.\",\n",
       "    'The RTX 30 Series also offers NVIDIA Reflex, a new technology that reduces system latency. Reflex is emerging as a must-have feature for eSports gamers who play competitive titles like Call of Duty: Warzone, Fortnite, Valorant and Apex Legends. We estimate that about 75% of GeForce gamers play eSport games and 99% of eSports pros compete on GeForce.',\n",
       "    \"We believe gaming also benefited from crypto mining demand, although it's hard to determine to what extent. We've taken actions to optimize GeForce GPUs for gamers, while separately addressing mining demand with crypto currency minding processors, or CMPs. last week, we announced that newly manufactured GeForce RTX 3080, RTX 3070, and RTX 3060 Ti graphics cards will have their Ethereum mining capabilities reduced by half and carry a low hash rate, or LHR identifier. Along with the updated RTX 3060, this should allow our partners to get more GeForce cards into the hands of gamers at better prices. To help address mining demand, CMP products launched this quarter, optimized for mining performance and efficiency. Because they don't meet the specifications required of a GeForce GPU, they don't impact the supply of GeForce GPUs to gamers. CMP revenue was $155 million in Q1, reported as part of the OEM and other category. And our Q2 outlook assumes CMP sales of $400 million.\",\n",

Hyperscale customers led our growth this quarter as they built infrastructure to commercialize AI in their services. In addition, cloud providers have adopted the A100 to support growing demand for AI from enterprises, start-ups and research organizations.

       "    \"Customers are increasingly migrated from CPUs to GPUs for AI inference for two chief reasons. First, GPUs can better keep up with the exponential growth in the size and the complexity of deep neural networks and respond with the required low latency. In April's MLPerf AI inference benchmark, NVIDIA achieved the top results across every category, spanning computer vision, medical imaging, recommender systems, speech recognition, and natural language processing; and second, NVIDIA's full stack inference platform including Triton's inference server software simplifies the complexity of deploying AI applications by supporting models from all major frameworks, and optimizing for different query types including batch, real time and streaming.

       "    'Questions and Answers:',\n",
       "    '[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from Timothy Arcuri with UBS.',\n",
       "    \"And I guess, second part of that is, within Data Center, I'm wondering, can you speak to the networking piece? It sounds like maybe it was up a bit more modestly than it's been up the past few quarters. I'm just wondering what the outlook is there. Thanks.\",\n",
       "    \"Yeah. Thanks so much for the question on our guidance. So I first want to start off with, we see demand really across all of our markets, all of our different market platforms, we do plan to grow sequentially. You are correct that we are expecting increase in our CMP and outside of our CMP growth, we expect the lion share of our growth to come from our Data Center and Gaming. In our Data Center business, right now, our product lineup couldn't be better. We have a strong overall portfolio both for training and inferencing and we're seeing strong demand across our hyperscales and vertical industries.\",\n",
       "    'Thanks a lot, Colette.',\n",
       "    \"I didn't answer your second question, my apologies, on Mellanox. Additionally, Mellanox is an important part of our data center. It is quite integrated with our overall products. We did continue to see growth. This last quarter and we are also expecting them to sequentially grow as we move into Q2. They are smaller part of our overall Data Center business. But again, we do expect them to grow.\",\n",
       "    'And your next question comes from C.J. Muse with Evercore ISI.',\n",
       "    'Yeah, good afternoon, thank you for taking the question. In your prepared remarks, I think I heard you talk about a vision for acceleration in data center as we go through the year. And as you think about the purchase obligations that you reported, up 45% year-on-year, how much of that is related to long lead time data center and how should we interpret that in terms of what kind of ramp we could see in the second half, particularly as you think about perhaps adding more growth from enterprise on top of what was hyperscale-driven growth in the April quarter? Thank you.',\n",
       "    \"So let me take the first part of your question regarding our purchasing, our purchasing of inventory and what we're seeing in just both our purchase commitments and our inventory. The market has definitely changed to where long lead times are required to build out our Data Center products. So we're on a steady stream to both commit longer term so that we can make sure that we can serve our customers with the great lineup of products that we have. So yes, a good part of those purchase commitments is really about the long lead times of the components to create the full systems.\",\n",
       "    'I will turn the second part of the question over to Jensen.',\n",
       "    'What was the second part of the question, Colette?',\n",
       "    \"Yeah. Yeah, we're seeing strength across the board in Data Centers and we're seeing strengthening demand. C.J., our data centers, as you know, is accelerating range of applications from scientific computing, both physical and life sciences, data analytics and classical machine learning, cloud computing and cloud graphics, which is becoming more important because of remote work and very importantly, AI, both for training, as well as inferencing for classical machine learning models like XGBoost, all the way to deep learning based models like conversational AI, natural language understanding, recommender systems and so on. And so, we have a large suite of applications and our NVIDIA AI and NVIDIA HPC as the case, accelerate these applications and data centers. They run on systems that range from HGX for the hyperscalers to DGX for on-prem to EGX for enterprise and edge, all the way out to our AGX, autonomous systems.\",\n",
       "    \"The rest of the data center is doing great too. As Colette mentioned, hyperscale demand is strengthening. We're seeing that for computing and networking. You know that the world's cloud data centers are moving to deep learning because every small percentage that they get out of predictive inference drives billions and billions of dollars of economics for them. And so, the movement toward deep learning shifts the data center workload away from CPUs because accelerators are so important. And so, hyperscale, we're seeing great traction and great demand.\",\n",
       "    'And your next question comes from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo.',\n",
       "    \"Yeah, thanks for taking the questions. Congratulation on the results. I'm going to try to slip in two of them here. First of all, Colette, I think in the past, you talked about how much of your gaming installed base is kind of on the pre-ray tracing platforms are really kind of in context behind the upgrade cycle, that's still in front of us. That's going to question one.\",\n",
       "    \"And then, on the heels of the last question, I'm just curious, things like VMware's Project Monterey as we think about the BlueField-2 product and Bluefield-3, how should we think about those starting to become or when should they become really material incremental revenue growth contributors for the Company? Thank you.\",\n",
       "    \"So, yeah, we have definitely discussed in terms of the great opportunity that we have in front of us of folks moving to our ray-traced GPUs and we're in the early stages of that. We had a strong cycle already, but still we probably have approximately 15% moving up a little bit from that at this time. So it's a great opportunity for us to continue to upgrade a good part of that installed base, not only just with our desktop GPUs, but the RTX laptops are also a great driver of growth and upgrading folks to RTX.\",\n",
       "    'Colette, do you want me take the second one?',\n",
       "    'Yes, please.',\n",
       "    \"The other half of the computing is completely soaked up running the software-defined data center, just to provide for those applications. And that you could imagine, even accepting if you like, as the cost of doing business. However, it commingles the infrastructure, the security plane and the application plane and exposes the data center to attackers. And so you fundamentally want to change the architecture as a result of that. To offload that software-defined virtualization and the infrastructure operating system, if you will, and the security services to accelerate it, because Moore's Law has ended and moving software that was running on one set of CPUs, which is really, really good already, to another set of CPUs is going to make it more effective. Separating it doesn't make it more effective.\",\n",
       "    \"Now, how big is this market? The way to think about that is every single networking chip in the world will be a smart networking chip. It will be a programmable, accelerated infrastructure processor. And that's what the DPU is. It's a data center on a chip. And I believe every single server node will have it, it will replace today's mix with something like BlueField, and it will offload about half of the software processing that's consuming data centers today, but most importantly, it will enable this future world where every single packet, every single application is being monitored in real time all the time for intrusion. And so how big is that application, how big is that market? Just 25 million servers a year, that's the size of the market and we know the servers are growing. And so those give you a feeling for that.\",\n",
       "    \"And in the future, servers are going to move out to the edge and all of those edge devices will have something like BlueField. And then how we're doing? We're doing PLCs now with just about every Internet company. We're doing really exciting work there. We've included it in high-performance computing, so that it's possible for supercomputers in the future to be cloud-native, to be zero-trust, to be secured, and still be a supercomputer, and then we expect next year to have meaningful, if not significant revenues contribution from BlueField, and this is going to be a really large growth market for us. You can tell, I'm excited about this and I put a lot of my energy into it. The Company is working really hard on it, and this is a form of accelerated computing, that's going to really make a difference.\",\n",
       "    'And your next question comes from Vivek Arya with Bank of America Securities.',\n",
       "    \"Thanks for taking my question. Jensen, is NVIDIA able to ring fence, this crypto impact in your CMP product? So even if, let's say crypto goes away, for whatever reason, the decline is a lot more predictable and manageable than what we saw in the 2018, '19 cycle. And then kind of part B of that is, how do you think about your core PC gamer demand? Because when we see these kind of 106% year-on-year growth rate, it brings questions of sustainability. So give us your perspectives on these two topics, just how does one ring fence kind of the crypto effect and what do you think about the sustainability of your core PC gamer demand? Thank you.\",\n",
       "    \"And what makes it different this time is several things. One, we're in the beginning of our RTX cycle, whereas Pascal was the last GTX. And now exactly was at the tail end of the GTX cycle. It was the last GTX and it was the tail-end of GTX cycle. We're at the very beginning of the RTX 30 cycle. And because we reinvented computer graphics, we reset the computer industry. And after three years, the entire graphics industry has followed. Every game developers need to do ray tracing, every content developer and every content tool has moved to ray tracing. And so if you move to ray tracing, these applications are so much better, and they simply run too slow on GTXs. And so we're seeing a reset of the install base, if you will.\",\n",
       "    'And your next question comes from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse.',\n",
       "    \"Yeah, good afternoon, guys. Thanks for letting me ask a question. Jensen, I had two hopefully quick questions. First, I harken back to the mantra you guys put out a couple of analysts days ago, the more you spend, the more you save. And you've always been very successful as you brought down the cost of doing something to really drive penetration growth. And so I'm curious with the NVIDIA enterprise AI software stack. Is there a sense that you can give us as how much that brings down the cost of deployment in AI inside the enterprise? And do you think whether COVID lockdown related or cost related, there's pent-up demand that this unlocks?\",\n",
       "    \"The more you buy, the more you shall save, there's no question about that. And the reason for that is because we're in the business of accelerated computing. We don't accelerate every application. However, for the applications we do accelerate, the acceleration is so dramatic and because we sell a component, the entire system, the TCO, the TCO of the entire system, and all the service and all the people and the infrastructure and the energy cost, has been reduced by X factors, sometimes 10 times, sometimes 15 times, sometimes 5 times.\",\n",
       "    \"And so this new way of taking our products to market, whereas our cloud business is going to continue to grow, and that's that part of AI is going to continue to grow, that business is direct, we sell components directly to them, we support them directly. But there are 10 of those customers in the world. For enterprises, there are thousands; industries, far and wide. And so we now have a great stack and a great software stack that allows us to take it to the world's market so that everybody could buy more and save more.\",\n",
       "    'And your final question comes from Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein.',\n",
       "    \"Hi, guys, thanks for taking my questions. This one's for Colette. So, Colette, last quarter, you had kind of suggested that Q1 would be the trough for, I guess, for gaming, as well as the rest of the Company, but gaming in particular, and it would grow sequentially through the year. I guess given the strength we're seeing in the first half, you still believe that that is the case? And I kind of heard you guys, I think kind of dance around that point a little bit in response to one of the other questions, but could you clarify that? Is that still your belief that that core gaming business can grow sequentially through the rest of the year? And I guess same core, same question as well for data center, especially since sounds like hyperscale is now coming back, like after a few quarters of digestion and then all of the other tailwinds you talked about. I mean, is there any reason to think that data center itself shouldn't also grow sequentially, like through the rest of the year?\",\n",
       "    \"Yeah, Stacy, thanks for the question. So I first want to start with, when we talked about our Q1 results and when we're looking at Q1, we were really discussing a lot about what we expected between Q4 and Q1. Given what we knew was still high demand for gaming, we believed we will continue to grow between Q4 and Q1, which often we don't, and we absolutely have the strength and overall demand to grow. What that then led was, again, continued growth from Q1 to Q2, as we are working hard to provide more supply for the strong demand that we see.\",\n",
       "    \"We have talked about that we have additional supply coming. We expect to continue to grow as we move into the second half of the year as well for gaming. Now, we only guide one quarter at a time. But our plan is to take the supply, serve the overall gamers, work on building up the channel as we know the channel is quite lean. And so, yes, we do and still expect growth in the second half of the year particularly when we see the lineup of games on the holiday overall coming, the back to school, all very important cycles for us. And there's a great opportunity to upgrade this RTX installed base.\",\n",
       "    \"Now, in terms of data center, we'll work in terms of our guidance here. We have growth from Q1 to Q2 planned in our overall guidance. And we do see as things continue to open up, a time to accelerate in the second half of the year for data center. We have, again, a great lineup of products here. Couldn't be a better lineup, now that we've also added the Infineon products, and the host of overall applications that are using our software that we have. So this could be an opportunity as well to see that continued growth. We'll work in terms of serving the supply that we need for both of these markets. But yes, we can see definitely growth in the second half of the year.\",\n",
       "    \"There are no further questions at this time. CEO, Jensen Huang, I'll turn the call back over to you.\",\n",
       "    'Well, thank you. Thank you for joining us today. NVIDIA computing platform is accelerating. Launched at GTC, we are now ramping new platforms and initiatives.

       "    'Thanks, Simona. Q4 was another record quarter with revenue exceeding $5 billion and year-on-year growth accelerating to 61%. Full year revenue was also a record at $16.7 billion, up 53%. Our Gaming business reached record revenue of $2.5 billion in Q4, up 10% sequentially and up 67% from a year earlier. Full year Gaming revenue was a record of $7.8 billion, up 41%. Demand is incredible for our new GeForce RTX 30 Series products based on the NVIDIA Ampere GPU architecture. In early December, we launched the GeForce RTX 3060 Ti, which joined the previously launched RTX 3090, 3080, and 3070. The entire 30 Series lineup has been hard to keep in stock and we exited Q4 with channel inventories even lower than when we started. Although we are increasing supply, channel inventories will likely remain low throughout Q1.',\n",
       "    'GeForce RTX 30 Series graphics cards were a holiday sensation due not just to their amazing performance but also to the rich features including our second-generation RTX ray tracing technology and DLSS, AI powered performance accelerator, which massively boosts frame rates in graphically demanding titles. 3,000 games now support RTX including the top battle royale game, Fortnite; the top role playing game, Cyberpunk 2077; the top massively multiplayer online game, World of Warcraft; and the best selling game of all-time, Minecraft. RTX has clearly set the new standard in gaming.',\n",
       "    'Building on this momentum, at CES in January, we introduced a wave of Ampere architecture gaming products, including our biggest ever laptop launch powered by GeForce RTX 3060, 3070 and 3080 laptop GPUs and with our third generation Max-Q technology. These new thin and lightweight gaming laptops increase performance and energy efficiency by up to 2 times from the prior generation. RTX 3060 laptops start $999 and are faster than the previous generation laptops, which sold for $2,500. The incredible performance, design, and price points of these new laptops will delight the growing universe of gamers and creators as well as students and professionals.',\n",
       "    'The gaming laptop market has grown seven-fold in the past seven years and momentum is building. With top OEMs bringing to market a record 70 plus laptop models based on the GeForce RTX 30 Series. GeForce laptops as a whole are the fastest growing and one of the largest gaming platforms. Also at CES, we announced the GeForce RTX 3060 GPU priced at $329, extending the 30 Series desktop lineup further into the mainstream. We expect strong demand when it launches this Friday as 60-class GPUs have traditionally been our most popular products.',\n",
       "    \"Starting with the 3060, we're taking an important step to maximize the supply of GeForce GPUs for gamers. Users are constantly discovering new applications for our powerful, programmable GPUs and cryptocurrency mining is one of them. With rising Ethereum prices, there are indications that miners are behind GPUs. We would like GeForce GPUs to end up with gamers. So we have created new special software drivers that will detect the Ethereum mining algorithm, cutting in half the mining efficiency of the GeForce RTX 3060.\",\n",
       "    \"We suspect the significant increase in the Ethereum network hash rate observed over the past few months was driven by a combination of previously installed mining capacity that was reactivated as well as new sales of GPUs and ASICs. Since our GPUs are sold to graphics card manufacturers and then on to distribution, we don't have the ability to accurately track or quantify their end-use. Analyst estimates suggest that crypto mining contributed $100 million to $300 million to our Q4 revenue, a relatively small portion of our Gaming revenue in Q4.\",\n",
       "    \"Cryptocurrencies have recently started to be accepted by companies and financial institutions and show increased signs of staying power. To address industrial Ethereum mining demand, last week, we announced a new line of NVIDIA CMPs or Crypto Mining Processors. Shipments will start in March. CMP's lack display outputs and have other optimizations that improve crypto mining power efficiency. CMP products will let us gain some visibility into the contribution of crypto mining to our overall revenue. For Q1, we estimate that CMP will contribute approximately $50 million. We plan to sell these products to industrial miners. We will quantify their contribution each quarter for transparency.\",\n",
       "    \"Over the past year, it has become clear that we've entered a new era in which gaming is an integral part of global culture. The number of concurrent users on Steam has more than doubled since 2018 and continues to hit new records. In 2020 alone, more than 100 billion hours of gaming content was seen on YouTube and 0.5 billion people watched eSports. Increasingly, we aren't just gaming, we're also watching sports, kept attending concerts, creating content, and connecting with our friends in virtual environments.\",\n",
       "    'Additionally, we are excited about the new experiences like VR. Significantly more content is now available including arguably the first VR killer app, Beat Saber. And there is now almost 2 million VR users on Steam. And with these powerful structural shifts, we expect our Gaming business to remain on a robust growth trajectory. The GeForce RTX 30 Series GPUs have kicked off a powerful upgrade cycle and we estimate only around 15% of GeForce gamers own an RTX class GPU, which is merely to experience the beautiful ray traced graphics of modern games.',\n",
       "    'Moreover, the universe of gamers is rapidly expanding and the reach of GeForce has extended beyond gamers to some 45 million creators. In addition, Gaming revenue continues to benefit from a favorable mix shift as gamers and creators keep moving to higher-end GPUs. We expect another great year for GeForce.',\n",

Full year revenue was $1.1 [Phonetic] billion was down 13%. Strong sequential growth was driven primarily by a recovery in desktop workstations as some customers returned to the office and enterprises resumed purchases that have been deferred by the pandemic. Notebook GPUs grew sequentially to a record as enterprises continue to support remote workforce initiatives.',\n",
       "    'Looking ahead, the reopening of businesses will benefit desktop workstations, but longer-term workforce trends will likely shift our mix to notebook GPUs and cloud offerings. Healthcare was a standout vertical in the quarter with significant orders from GE, Siemens. and Oxford Nanopore Technologies. Public sector and automotive also showed strength.',\n",
       "    'Omniverse, our real-time 3D collaboration and simulation platform is now in open beta. Over 500 creators and professionals have tested Omniverse through our early access program.

Sequential growth was driven by continued recovery in the global automotive production volumes and growth in AI cockpit revenue. The year-on-year decline reflects the expected ramp down of legacy infotainment. NVIDIA has emerged as the industry's leading end-to-end full stack technology provider for self-driving and AI-enabled vehicles. Orin, the SoC that DRIVE self-driving platform is built on delivers an unrivaled 254 trillions of operations per second of performance on industry-leading power efficiency helping to revolutionize the transportation industry.\",\n",

We have great momentum with an expanding list of electric vehicle OEMs including Nio, SAIC, Li Auto, and Xpeng which are all using the NVIDIA DRIVE platform to power their next-generation of vehicles. We look forward to growing with them as they continue to scale. Our software defined platform is the only solution that spans from the data center for training deep neural nets and running physically accurate simulations to a full stack in car solutions, scaling from ADAS to level 5 fully autonomous functionality.',\n",

Data Center compute revenue was up 45% year-on-year. Full-year Data Center revenue rose 125% to a record $6.7 billion, including almost 70% growth from data center computer. From a sequential perspective, the Data Center compute's stronger than expected double-digit growth more than offset the anticipated decline in Mellanox revenue, which included a large non-recurring network sale to a single OEM in Q3.\",\n",
       "    'Compute growth was led by vertical industries where OEM partners continued ramping up their A100 based servers and our own DGX system sales were strong. Vertical industries were well over 50% of Data Center revenue across compute and networking with particular strength in supercomputing, financial services, higher education, and consumer Internet verticals. Additionally, hyperscale customers continued to deploy the A100 driving both sequential growth and exceptionally strong year-on-year growth in Data Center compute.',\n",

Still, we are in the early stages of adoption and expect continued growth this year. The ramp of the A100 has been smoother and accomplished by better visibility with higher generation. Its universal AI training and inference capabilities as well as support for a wider set of applications and outstanding performance are driving high customer utilization, a clear sign of the A100's value.\",\n",
       "    \"Turning to Mellanox, we are seeing continued strong traction and robust momentum across our customer sets. Its revenue was up over 30% from Mellanox's Q4 revenue in calendar 2019 when it was still a stand-alone company. Year-on-year growth in the quarter was led by hyperscale and large consumer Internet customers which grew over 60% from last year with several contributing record revenues. Consistent with our outlook, Mellanox had a sequential decline impacted by a non-recurring sales to a China OEM in Q3.\",\n",
       "    'We expect to return to sequential growth in Q1 driven by strong demand for our high-speed networking products, including the ramp of ConnectX adapters with CSPs and all major server OEMs in their upcoming refresh. We also see strong momentum in high-performance computing with HDR InfiniBand products. For example, we won six of the seven supercomputers awarded over the past few months by EuroHPC. Starting next quarter, we will continue to provide color on networking as part of the data center market platform, but we will no longer breakout Mellanox revenues separately.',\n",
       "    \"Looking forward, we are incredibly excited about the opportunities in data center. Accelerated computing is not only delivering super Moore's Law [Phonetic] gains in performance but is also an energy efficient and cost effective method of computing and virtually every industry is adopting technology with greater urgency as companies adapt to the new world of more distributed workers and customers. As industries embark on this journey, they are also increasingly focused on combating climate change.\",\n",
       "    \"To that end, the A100 performs AI computations with one-twentieth the power consumption of CPUs. It powers our Selene supercomputer which is number one on the Green500 List of the world's most efficient supercomputers. Indeed, NVIDIA's powered machines recently captured 25 of the Top 30 spots on the Green500 List. Accelerated computing is not only serving the exponential growth in demand for compute, it can also help bend the power consumption curve. With accelerated computing, NVIDIA is pioneering a path forward the computing industry.\",\n",
       "    'Before I move to the P&L and outlook, let me give you an update on our proposed acquisition of Arm. In September, we announced plans to acquire Arm from SoftBank Group in a transaction that will create the premier computing company for the age of AI. At that time, we said it would take approximately 18 months to secure regulatory approvals in the U.S., the U.K., the EU, China and other jurisdictions. Thorough reviews are typical with a deal of this size. This process is moving forward as expected. We are in constructive dialog with the relevant authorities and are confident that regulators will see the benefits to the entire tech ecosystem.',\n",
       "    \"As we have said, this combination will spur competition. Together Arm and NVIDIA will provide greater choice to the data center ecosystem, a compelling alternative CPU architecture for the market, and further enhance Arm's offering in mobile and embedded. Our intention is to increase investment in Arm's existing road map, adding resources to stimulate growth in new markets. We love and intend to maintain Arm's open licensing model, a commitment guaranteed both by long-term legally binding contracts as well as our own interest in ensuring this investment is a profitable one for us.\",\n",
       "    \"We are on the cusp of a new age in which AI fuels industries ranging from healthcare to scientific research to the environment. With this transaction, our vision is to boost Arm's potential so it can thrive in this new era and grow into promising new markets.\",\n",
       "    'Moving to the rest of the P&L, Q4 GAAP gross margins were 63.1% and non-GAAP gross margins were 65.5%. GAAP gross margins declined year-on-year due to amortization of developed technology acquired from Mellanox, partially offset by product mix. The sequential increase was due to higher margins for Gaming GPU and lower IP-related costs partially offset by lower margin mix in our Data Center portfolio. Non-GAAP gross margins increased by 10 basis points year-on-year and was flat sequentially, in line with our expectations. Q4 GAAP EPS was $2.31, up 51% from a year earlier. Non-GAAP EPS was $3.10, up 64% from a year ago. Q4 cash from operations was a record $2.07 billion.',\n",

       "    \"Good afternoon, thank you for taking the question. I guess, Jensen, higher level question for you on the enterprise side. You're now a couple of quarters into the ramp of A100 and curious if you could speak to whether you've seen any surprises here, any areas of specific strength worth calling out and any changes to how you're thinking about the size of this opportunity?\",\n",
       "    'Your next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya with BofA Securities. Your line is open.',\n",
       "    'Thanks for taking my question. Just a clarification and then a question for Jensen. On the clarification, Colette, I was hoping if you could give a little more color around Q1. Do you still expect the data center to grow sequentially in Q1. I know you said that most of the growth will come from Gaming, but any color on the data center would be useful.',\n",
       "    \"And then Jensen, the question for you is in your press release you used the phrase AI driving the smartphone moment for every industry. Could you help us quantify what that means and where I'm going with that is, is there a number in terms of what percentage of servers are shipping today with your accelerators and where can that ratio go over time. Is that a fair way of looking at the adoption of your technology and AI?\",\n",
       "    'So, thank you, Vivek. Your question regarding the guidance as we lead into Q1. We had indicated that yes, a good percentage of our growth between Q4 and Q1 will stem from Gaming but we also do expect Data Center to grow. Most of our sequential growth coming from Gaming, but keep in mind, we also expect all of our market platforms will likely be able to grow quarter-over-quarter.',\n",
       "    'Your next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research. Your line is open.',\n",
       "    \"Hi guys, thanks for taking my question. First, I don't want to be pedantic I suppose, but I guess on the Q1 guide, you're saying that Gaming is the majority of the growth. Was that an absolute statement or was that a percentage statement? Can you give some idea of how you would sort of rank the sequential percentage growth of say Gaming versus Data Center versus other especially since it sounds like you've got $50 million in crypto specific stuff that will go into the other.\",\n",
       "    \"Colette will take one and I'll take the other.\",\n",
       "    \"Sure, let me start off of Stacy in terms of our guidance for Q1. As you know, we're still in the early innings of our Ampere architecture as it relates to Gaming as well as what it relates to Data Center. As we articulated in our call, we have been really seeing continued uplift of folks adoption of A100 and it's going quite smoothly than what we had seen in prior overall versions. So when we think about our guidance for Q1, there's many different types of conclusions that will happen at the end of the quarter in terms of what we ship, but all of our platforms can grow, but the majority of the growth from Q4 to Q1 will likely be Gaming.\",\n",
       "    \"You asked a question about the lead times. At the company level, we're supply constrained. Our demand is greater than our supply. However for Data Center, so long as the customers work closely with us and we do a good job planning between our companies, there shouldn't be a supply issue for Data Centers. We just have to do a good job planning and we have direct relationships with each one of the world CSPs and we have direct relationships with all the OEMs and we can do excellent planning between us. We shouldn't be supply constrained there, but at the company level, we're supply constrained, demand is greater than supply.\",\n",
       "    \"We usually have enough supply to achieve better than the outlook and we had that situation in Q4 and we expect that situation in Q1 and we have enough supply to grow through the year, but supply is constrained and demand is really, really great and so we just have to do a really good job on planning. Meanwhile, one of the things that really came through for us is we have the world's best operations team. Our company really has an amazing operations team. We build the most complex products in the world, the most complex chips, the most complex packages, the most complex systems and during Q4, they improved our cycle time and during Q1, I'm expecting them to improve our cycle time again and we really are blessed to have such an amazing operations and so during these times, it really comes in handy, but overall at the company level, we expect demand to be greater than supply. We have enough supply to do better than the outlook and we have enough supply to grow each quarter throughout the year.\",\n",
       "    'Your next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Your line is open.',\n",
       "    \"Hi, thanks, I had a question on crypto. I guess Jensen, I know that the CMP stuff and the software drivers stuff that you're doing for the 36 [Phonetic], that's going to help a lot, but I think that there is like four or five of the big currency are going to move or at least they are moving or they are on a path to move from a proof-of-work to proof of stake, which is going to be a lot less compute intensive. So I guess the question that I get a lot is how do you assess the degree to which that drives GPUs back into the secondary market. Is there any way that you can get kind of a handle on that? Thanks.\",\n",
       "    \"We developed CMP for this very reason so that there are different versions. We have different versions of our products for Gaming, for Professional Visualization, for high performance computing, for deep learning, it stands to reason we have to build a different version for CMP and we can sell it directly the way that we go to market would be to go to directly to the industrial miners and it's a great benefit to them so that they don't have to chase around spot markets, it's a great benefit to the gamers because they want to game and the game demand is just incredible, it's off the chart and so I think this is going to be really beneficial to everybody.\",\n",
       "    \"The recent hash rate growth was really a result of several dynamics. The first dynamic is the installed base. Most people thought that once the mining GPUs come back into the aftermarket, a small part does that, some people do that, but the vast majority of them keep them and the reason for that is because obviously they believe in Ethereum and they are industrial miners, that's what they do and so they keep it around for when the profitability returns and they could kick start their mining gear.\",\n",
       "    \"That's what we saw in the latter part of last year. We saw the hash rate starting to grow. Most of that was resulting from the installed miners reactivating their equipment. It wasn't until earlier this year that we started to see demand in our own GPUs and when that starts to happen, there are several different dynamics. The primary source these days come from powerful ASICs and then there are some that comes from our GPU and other GPUs in the marketplace. And so I think that this is going to be a part of our business. It won't grow extremely large no matter what happens and the reason for that is because when it starts to grow large, more ASICs come to the market, which kinds of mutes it and when the market becomes smaller, it's harder for ASICs to sustain the R&D and so the spot miners, industrial miners come back and then we'll create CMPs.\",\n",
       "    \"And so we expect it to be a small part of our business as we go forward. One of the important things is to realize that in the near-term because we're in the beginning parts of our Ampere ramp, only two quarters into a multi-year cycle. This is also the first time that we've completely changed our computer graphics. RTX using ray tracing is completely different than rasterization and so this is a fundamental change in the way we do computer graphics and the results have been spectacular. There is some 200 million installed base in desktops and 50 million in laptop and the vast majority of them we've only upgraded like approximately I think its something like 15% of the installed base that's been upgraded to RTX and so there is a giant installed base and the installed base is growing that will need update to the next generation of computer graphics.\",\n",
       "    'Your next question comes from the line of John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.',\n",
       "    \"Yeah, guys, thanks for letting me ask the question, I want to go back to Data Center, you've been very kind over the last couple of quarters to call out Mellanox both when it was a positive driver and when it was a headwind. I'm kind of curious as you when you look into the fiscal first quarter, is there anything of distinction to mention around Mellanox versus core Data Center.\",\n",
       "    \"And I guess as a follow-on, the key metric that a lot of investors are looking at is when does the core data center business year-over-year growth start to reaccelerate and some of that is just simple math, you're just comping very hard compares from last year, but Jensen, how would you think about Data Center year-over-year growth in the context of a reopening trade or any sort of new applications out there. What helped it last time around was the move to natural language AI, is there another big sort of AI application we should be thinking about as we think about Data Center growth reaccelerating?\",\n",
       "    \"One of the new initiatives and we're going to see success toward the second half because the number of adoption and the number of engagements on new BlueField-2 DPUs. It's used for virtualization, for hyperscalers, it's also used for security. As you know quite well, the future of computing is cloud and its multi-tenant cloud and there is no VPN front door to the cloud. You got millions of people who are using every aspect of computing. So you need to have distributed firewalls and you can't have it just in one place. The intense focus of security across all of the data centers around the world is really creating a great condition for BlueField which is really perfect for them.\",\n",
       "    \"So I expect our Mellanox networking business to grow very nicely this year and we expect Q1 to be a great growth quarter for compute as well as Mellanox. The great driving application for AI are several. Last year, you're absolutely right [Indecipherable] in other versions like that really made it possible for us to enable all kinds of new applications. So you're going to see natural language understanding do text completion, it's going to be integrated, I think it was just announced today that it was going to be integrated into Microsoft Word.\",\n",
       "    \"The other big huge driver is recommenders. This is something really worthwhile to take a look at it, it's called deep learning recommender models and recommenders have historically whether it's for shopping or personalizing websites or personalizing your store, recommending your basket, recommending your music. Historically it's been used in traditional machine learning algorithms, but because of the accuracy and just the extraordinary economic impact that comes from an incremental 1% in accuracy for most of the world's large Internet businesses, people are moving very rapidly to deep learning based model and these models are gigantic, they are utterly gigantic and so this is an area that is really driving high performance computing. I expect this to see a lot of momentum.\",\n",
       "    \"And the last one is the one that I just spoke about, which has to do with industrial 5G and Edge IoT type of applications for all of the different industries whether it's retail or logistics or transportation, agriculture or warehouses to factories. And so we're going to see AI and robotics in a very large number of applications and industries and we're just seeing so much excitement there.\",\n",

       "    \"Yeah, thanks for taking the questions. I wanted to go back again on the Data Center business that you just mentioned, Jensen, that the BlueField-2 product poised to kind of ramp materialize in the back half of the calendar year. How do you see that? Is it an attach rate? I think there's some discussions in the past about all servers could potentially over time incorporate this layer of acceleration. How quickly should we think about that ramp? And then the second question, can you just at a high level talk about how a CPU strategy you're thinking about that in the context of the broader data center market?\",\n",
       "    'Sure, if I could just work backwards, I believe that every single data center node will be outfitted with a DPU some day and that some day is probably call it five years from now and the fundamental driver of it is going to be security. Every single application in the data center and every single node in the data center has to be individually secured. Zero Trust computing, zero or confidential computing or Zero Trust computing, these initiatives are going to cause every data center to have every single application and every single node to be secured, which was every one of those computers have to have a control plane that is isolated from the application plane and all the applications cannot share the same resources because that application could be malware, that application could be an intruder.',\n",
       "    \"CPUs, we support every CPU in the world and we're the only accelerated computing platforms that accelerates every CPU. Ironically, the only CPU we don't accelerate for AI is Arm, but we want to change that. Arm has such an exciting future because the nature of their business model and the nature of their architecture is perfect for the future of hyperscalers and data centers. You want the most energy efficiency in every single data center because every data center is power constrained. We are going to be power constraining in every aspect of computing going forward.\",\n",
       "    \"And so we would love to build around the Arm processor and invest in building a great ecosystem around it so that all the world's peripherals and all the world's applications can work on any one of the CPUs that we know today and so we're going to start with high performance computing and start with AI and all the areas that we have a lot of expertise in and build out that platform. So you're starting to see one industry leader after another embrace Arm and I think that's terrific, but now we've got to energize it with all of the ecosystem support. It can't just be vertical applications, but we want to create a broad general Arm ecosystem.\",\n",

       "    \"Hi, thanks for taking my question. Question for Jensen I think. Jensen, if you look at the past computing eras, typically, it's one ecosystem that captures 80% of the value of that computing era. In mainframes, it was IBM; in mini computers,it was DEC; PCs, Wintel; Cell phones, Nokia and then Apple. So if you don't get the ecosystem right then you're splitting 20% of the market with a handful of players. So in this next era of computing, parallel processing or AI, I think you've articulated the most compelling architectural vision of the data center of the future with data center scale, computing devices, with CPUs, GPUs, DPUs integrated in the same box serving all workloads, I imagine a virtualized environment. Can you help us understand where is the market in embracing that vision and where is NVIDIA in building out the ecosystem for that data center scale computing vision and maybe as part of that, to what extent is CUDA the kernel for that ecosystem? Thank you.\",\n",

If you tamper with it, it of course won't run and so the capability of these clouds will move all the way out to the edge and we're in the best position to be able to do that. So I think in this new world of post Moore's Law, post the NOW [Phonetic] gaming, in this new world where AI and software that writes software, in this new world where data centers are going to be literally everywhere and they are unprotected. I mean there's no giant building with a whole bunch of people to secure it and in this new world where software is going to enable this autonomous future.

In June, we announced a landmark partnership with Mercedes-Benz which, starting in 2024, will launch software-defined intelligent vehicles across an entire fleet in using end-to-end NVIDIA technology.',\n",
       "    \"Mercedes will utilize NVIDIA's full technology stack, including the DRIVE AGX computer, DRIVE AV autonomous driving software, and NVIDIA's AI infrastructure, spanning from the core to the cloud. Centralizing and unifying computing in the car will make it easier to integrate and upgrade advanced software features as they are developed. With over-the-air updates, vehicles can receive the latest autonomous driving and intelligent cockpit features, increasing value and extending majority of ownership with each software upgrade. This is a transformator announcement for the automotive industry, making the turning point of traditional vehicles becoming high-performance updatable data centers on wheels.\",\n",
       "    \"It's also a transformative announcement for NVIDIA's evolving business model as the software content of our platforms grows, positioning us to build a recurring revenue stream. Moving to data center. Data center is diverse, consist of cloud service providers, public cloud providers, supercomputing centers, enterprises, telecom, and industrial edge. Q2 revenue was a record $1.75 billion, up 167% year on year and up 54% sequentially.\",\n",
       "    'In Q2, we incorporated a full quarter of contribution from the Mellanox acquisition, which closed on April 27, the first day of our quarter. Non-ops contributed approximately 14% of company revenue and just over 30% of data center revenue. Both compute and networking within data center set a record with accelerating year on year growth. The biggest news in data center this quarter was the launch of our Ampere architecture.',\n",

The A100 is the largest chip ever made with 54 billion transistors. It runs our full software stack for accelerating the most compute-intensive workloads.

The first Ampere GPU, A100, has been widely adopted by all major server vendors and cloud service providers. Google Cloud Platform was the first cloud customer to bring it to market, making it the fastest GPU to come to the cloud in our history.\",\n",

And we announced that the A100 is going to market with more than 50 servers from leading vendors around the world, including Cisco, Dell, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, and Lenovo. Adoption of the A100 into leading server makers offerings is faster than any prior launch, with 30 systems expected this summer and over 20 more by the end of the year.',\n",

MLPerf offers the industry's first and only objective AI benchmark. Since the benchmark was introduced two years ago, NVIDIA has consistently delivered leading results and record performance for both training and inference. NVIDIA also topped the chart in the latest TOP500 list of the fastest supercomputers.\",\n",

They include the most powerful systems in the U.S. and Europe. NVIDIA, now combined with Mellanox, powers tow-thirds of the top 500 systems on the list compared with just less than a half for the two companies in total two years ago.\",\n",
       "    \"In energy efficiencies, systems using NVIDIA GPUs are pulling away from the pack. On average, they're nearly 2.8x more powerful and efficient than systems without NVIDIA GPUs, measured by gigaflops per watt. The incredible performance and efficiency of the A100 GPU is best amplified by NVIDIA's own new Selene supercomputer, which debuted as No.7 on the top 500 list and is the only top 100 systems to cross the 20 gigaflops per watt barrier. Our engineers were able to assemble Selene in less than four weeks using NVIDIA's open modular DGX SuperPOD reference architecture instead of the typical build time of months or even years.\",\n",
       "    \"This is the system that we will use to win the MLPerf benchmarks, and it is a reference design that's available for our customers to quickly build a world-class supercomputer. We also brought GPU acceleration to data analytics, one of the largest and fastest-growing enterprise workload. We enabled an acceleration of the entire data analytics workload pipeline for the first time with NVIDIA's GPUs and software stack in the latest version of Apache Spark released in June. Spark is the world's leading data analytics platform used by more than 500,000 data scientists and 16,000 enterprises worldwide.\",\n",

Jensen, I'm wondering how much of the strength that you're seeing in gaming and data center is, you know, maybe more temporary because COVID or, you know, some customer pull-ins in the data center or so forth? And how much of it is more structural and more secular that can continue even once we get into, hopefully, you know, sooner rather than later, into a more normalized period for the industry?\",\n",

A single application service could be running on multiple servers at the same time, which generates a ton of east-west traffic, and a lot of it is artificial intelligence neuro network models. And so, because of this type of architecture, two components, two types of technologies are really important to the future of cloud.',\n",

And when you've been asked in the past about moving to more of a tiled or chiplet approach, you sort of made light of that.\",\n",
       "    \"But the CPU guys are clearly picking that approach. So, I guess, the question is why do you think you won't have to make a similar move? And then on the side of architecture, the theme of Hot Chips this week was really how compute demand is far outstripping computing power? And then we see this, you know, talk about you and ARM. So, I guess can you talk about whether GPU is the future and, you know, maybe the broader opportunity to integrate CPU and GPU? Thanks.\",\n",
       "    'Yeah. We push architecture really hard. And the way we push architecture is we start from the system. But we believe that the future computer company is a data center-scale company.',\n",
       "    \"I mean, that's pretty remarkable thing. And that happened in the last several years. We were ahead of this trend, and we recognized that, you know, as a computing company, we have to be a data center-scale company, and we architect from that [Inaudible]. If you look at our architecture, we were the first in the world to create the concept of an NVLink, with eight processors being fully synchronized across the computing node, and we created the DGX.\",\n",

And then secondly, I was wondering, you know, Colette, could you just give me a kind of updated commentary or views on visibility in the data center business? How that – you know, how has that changed over the last three months? What does that look like as you look through the back half of the calendar year? Thank you.\",\n",
       "    \"We want it to be running concurrently to shading so that the ray traversal and the shading of the pixels could be done independently and concurrently. The second thing is we invented this technology to bring AI, artificial intelligence, using this new type of algorithm called deep learning to computer graphics. And one example of its capability is the algorithm we introduced called DLSS, Deep Learning Super Sampling, which allows us to essentially synthesize by learning from previous examples, essentially learning from previous examples of images and remembering it, remembering what beautiful images look like so that when you take a low-resolution image, and you run it through the deep neural network, it synthesizes a high-resolution image that's really, really beautiful. And people have commented that it's even more beautiful than native rendered images at the native resolution.\",\n",
       "    \"And the benefit is not only is it beautiful, it's also super fast. We essentially nearly doubled the performance of RTX as a result of doing that. So, you can have the benefit of ray tracing as well as very high resolution and very high speed. And so that's called RTX.\",\n",
       "    \"And Turing is probably not even close, not even one-third of the total installed base of all of our GeForce GPUS, which is, as you know, the single-largest installed base of gaming platforms in the world. And so, we support this large installed base, and we're in the process of bringing them to the future with RTX. And now, with the new console generation coming, every single game developer on the planet is going to be doing ray tracing, and they're going to be creating much, much richer content. And because of multi-platform, cross-platform play, and because of the size of the gaming platform, PC gaming platform, it's really important that these game developers bring the latest generation content to PCs, which is great for us.\",\n",
       "    'And then on the data center visibility?',\n",
       "    \"Yeah. Let me see if I can answer this one for you. Yes, we have been talking about our visibility of data center. And as you've seen in our Q2 results, you can see that our overall adoption of the NVIDIA computing portfolio has accelerated quite nicely.\",\n",
       "    \"But keep in mind, we're still really early in the product cycle. A100 is ramping. It's ramping very strong into our existing installed bases but also into new markets. Right now, A100 probably represents less than a quarter of our data center revenues.\",\n",
       "    'So we still have a lot to grow. We have good visibility looking into Q3 with our hyperscales. We have a little bit more of a mixed outlook in terms of our vertical industries, given a lot of the uncertainty in the market and in terms of the overall economy. On-premises are challenged because of the overall COVID.',\n",

And then the second question, Jensen, you know, I know you're very focused on platforms and driving recurring revenues. I would love to hear if there's any, you know, particular platforms over the last three months where you've made real headway or get you excited, whether Jarvis, Merlin, Spark or whatever. Thank you.\",\n",

       "    \"And the reason for that is because PC gaming has become such a large format. The combination of amazing games like Fortnite and Minecraft and because of the way people game now, their gaming and their e-sporting, even F1 is an e-sport now, they're hanging out with friends. They're using it to create other content. They're using, you know, game captures, create art.\",\n",
       "    \"And so, the PC has just become such a large platform for gaming. And the second thing is that RTX, it's a home run. You know, we really raised the bar with computer graphics, and the games are so beautiful, and it's really, really the next level. It's not been this amazing since we introduced programmable shaders about 15 years ago.\",\n",
       "    \"And so, for the last 15 years, we've been making programmable shaders better and better and better, and it has been getting better. But there's never been a giant leap like this.

Curious, is that something that you think about, worry about in your data center business? Or do you have enough idiosyncratic growth drivers like the A100 ramp? And I guess, the breadth that you've built within your data center business across compute and networking, are those enough for you to buck the trend within data center over the next six to 12 months? And then the second one for Colette, just on gross margins. You're guiding October-quarter gross margins down 50 basis points sequentially.

       "    \"So that it can continue to consume more and more capability and more technology. And then the third thing that we're indexed to is the movement of workloads to the cloud. It is now possible to do rendering in the cloud, remote graphics workstations in the cloud. And NVIDIA virtual workstations is in every single cloud.\",\n",

       "   'content': [\"Good afternoon, my name is Josh and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to NVIDIA's Financial Results Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you, Simona Jankowski, you may begin your conference.\",\n",
       "    \"Thank you. Good afternoon everyone and welcome to NVIDIA's conference call for the first quarter of fiscal 2021. With me on the call today from NVIDIA are Jensen Huang, President and Chief Executive Officer and Colette Kress, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. I'd like to remind you that our call is being webcast live on NVIDIA's Investor Relations website. The webcast will be available for replay until the conference call to discuss our financial results for the second quarter of fiscal 2021. The content of today's call is NVIDIA's property. It can't be reproduced or transcribed without our prior written consent.\",\n",
       "    \"During this call, we may make forward-looking statements based on current expectations. These are subject to a number of significant risks and uncertainties and our actual results may vary materially. For a discussion of factors that could affect our future financial results and business, please refer to the disclosure in today's earnings release, our most recent Forms 10-K and 10-Q, and the reports that we may file on Form 8-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission. All our statements are made as of today, May 21st, 2020 based on information currently available to us. Except as required by law, we assume no obligation to update any such statements. During this call, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures. We can find a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures in our CFO commentary, which is posted on our website. With that, let me turn the call over to Jensen.\",\n",
       "    \"Thanks, Simona. Before Colette describes our quarterly results, I'd like to thank those who are on the front lines of this crisis: first responders, healthcare workers, service providers who inspires every day with their bravery and selflessness. I also want to acknowledge the incredible efforts of our colleagues here at NVIDIA. Despite many challenges, they have barely broken stride during one of the busiest periods in our history. Our efforts related to the virus are focused in three areas. First, we're taking care of our families and communities. We've pulled in raises by six months to put more money in our employees hands and NVIDIA and our people have donated thus far more than $10 million to those in need.\",\n",
       "    \"Second, we're using NVIDIA's unique capabilities to fight the virus. A great deal of science being done on COVID-19 uses NVIDIA technology for acceleration. Some of the many examples including sequencing the virus, analyzing drug candidates, imaging the virus at molecular resolution with cryo-electron microscopy, and identifying elevated body temperature with AI cameras. And third, because COVID-19 won't be the last killer virus, we need to be ready for the next outbreak. NVIDIA technology is essential for the scientific community to develop an end-to-end computational defense system, a system that can detect early, accelerate the development of a vaccine, contain the spread of disease, and continuously test and monitor.\",\n",
       "    'We are racing to deploy the NVIDIA Clara computational healthcare platforms. Clara Parabricks can accelerate genomics analysis from days to minutes. Clara Imaging will continue to partner with leading research institutes to develop state-of-the-art AI models to detect infections, and Clara Guardian will connect AI to cameras and microphones in hospitals to help overloaded staff watch over patients.',\n",
       "    \"We completed the acquisition of Mellanox on April 27th. Mellanox is now NVIDIA's networking brand and business unit and will be reported as part of our data center market platform, and Israel is now one of NVIDIA's major technology centers. The new NVIDIA has a much larger footprint in data center computing, end-to-end and full stack expertise in data center architectures and tremendous scale to accelerate innovation. NVIDIA and Mellanox are a perfect combination and position us for the major forces shaping the IT industry today, data center scale computing and AI.\",\n",
       "    \"From micro service cloud applications to machine learning and AI, accelerated computing and high performance networking are critical to modern data centers. Previously, a CPU compute node was the unit of computing. Going forward, the new unit of computing is an entire data center. The basic computing elements are now storage servers, CPU servers, and GPU servers and are composed and orchestrated by hyperscale applications that are serving millions of users simultaneously. Connecting these computing elements together is the high performance Mellanox networking. This is the era of data center scale computing and together, NVIDIA and Mellanox can architect end-to-end. Mellanox is an extraordinary company and I'm thrilled that we're now one force to invent the future together. Now let me turn the call over to Colette.\",\n",
       "    'Thanks, Jensen. Against the backdrop of the extraordinary events unfolding around the globe, we had a very strong quarter. Q1 revenue was $3.08 billion, up 39% year-on-year, down 1% sequentially and slightly ahead of our outlook reflecting upside in our data center and gaming platforms. Starting with gaming, revenue of $1.34 billion was up 27% year-on-year and down 10% sequentially. We are pleased with these results which exceeded expectations in the quarter marked by the unprecedented challenge of the COVID-19.',\n",
       "    'Let me give you some color. Early in Q1, as the epidemic unfolded, demand in China was impacted with iCafes closing for an extended period. As the virus spread globally, much of the world started working and learning from home and gameplay surged. Globally, we have seen 50% rise in gaming hours played on our GeForce platform driven both by more people playing and more gameplay per user. With many retail outlets closed, demand for our products has shifted quite efficiently to e-tail channels globally. Gaming laptops revenue accelerated to its fastest year-on-year growth in six quarters. We are working with our OEMs, channel partners to meet the growing needs of the professionals and students engaged in working, learning, and playing at home.',\n",
       "    'In early April, our global OEM partners announced a record new 100 NVIDIA GeForce powered laptops with availability starting in Q1 and the most to ship in Q2. These laptops are the first to use our high-end NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080 SUPER and 2070 SUPER GPUs, which have been available for desktop since last summer. In addition, OEMs are bringing to market laptops based on the RTX 2060 GPU at just $999, a price point that enables a larger audience to take advantage of the power and features of RTX including its unique ray tracing and AI capabilities. These launches are well timed as mobile and remote computing needs accelerate. The global rise in gaming also lifted sales of NVIDIA, Nintendo Switch and our console business driving strong growth both sequentially and year-over-year.',\n",
       "    \"We collaborated with Microsoft and Mojang to bring RTX ray tracing to Minecraft, the world's most popular game with over 100 million gamers monthly and over 100 billion total views on YouTube. Minecraft with RTX looks astounding with realistic shadows and reflections, light that reflects, refracts, and scatters through surfaces as naturalistic effects like fog. Reviews for it are off the charts. Ars Technica called it a jaw-dropping stunner and PC World said it was glorious to behold. Our RTX technology stands apart not only with our two-year lead in ray tracing, but with its use of AI to speed up and enhance games using the Tensor Core silicon on our RTX-class GPUs. We introduced the next version of our AI algorithm called deep learning super sampling. In real-time, DLSS 2.0 can fill the missing bits from every frame, doubling performance. It represents a major step function from the original and it can be trained on non-gaming specific images making it universal and easy to implement. The value and momentum of our RTx GPUs continue to grow. We have a significant upgrade opportunity over the next year with the rising tide of RTx enabled games, including major blockbusters like Minecraft and Cyberpunk. Let me also touch on our game streaming service, GFN which exited beta this quarter. It gives gamers access to more than 650 games, with another 1,500 in line to get on-boarded. These include Epic Games' Fortnite, which is the most played game on GFN and other popular titles such as Control, Destiny 2 and League of Legends with Cyberpunk joining in the fall. Since launching in February GFN has added 2 million users around the world with both sign-ups and hours of game playing boosted by stay-at-home measures. GFN expands our market reach to the billions of gamers with underpowered devices. It is the most publisher-friendly, developer-friendly game streaming service with the greatest number of games and the only one that supports ray tracing.\",\n",
       "    \"Moving to Pro Visualization. Revenue was $307 million, up 15% year-on-year and down 7% sequentially. Year-on-year revenue growth accelerated in Q1, driven by laptop workstations and Turing adoption. We are seeing continued momentum in our ecosystem for RTx ray tracing. We now have RTx support for all major rendering visualization and design software packages, including Autodesk Maya, Dassault's CATIA, Pixar's RenderMan, Chaos Group's V-Ray and many others. Autodesk has announced that the latest release of VRED its automotive 3D visualization software supports NVIDIA RTx GPUs. This enables designers to take advantage of RTx to produce more like-life designs in a fraction of the time versus CPU base systems. Over 45 leading creative and design applications now take advantage of RTx driving a sustained upgrade opportunity for Quadro powered systems, while also extending their reach.\",\n",
       "    'We see strong demand in verticals including healthcare, media and entertainment and higher education among others. Higher healthcare demand was fueled in part by COVID-19 related research at Siemens, Oxford and Caption Health. Caption Health received FDA clearance for an update to its AI guided ultrasound making it easier to perform diagnostics quality cardiac ultrasound. And in media and entertainment demand increased as companies like Disney deployed remote workforce initiatives.',\n",
       "    'Turning to automotive and robotic autonomous machines. Automotive revenue was $155 million, down 7% year-on-year and down 5% sequentially. The automotive industry is seeing a significant impact from the pandemic and we expect that to affect our revenue in the second quarter as well, likely declining about 40% from Q1. Despite the near-term challenges, our important work continues. We believe that every machine that moves someday will have autonomous capabilities. During the quarter, Xpeng introduced the P7, an all-electric sports sedan with innovative level 3 automated driving features, powered by the NVIDIA DRIVE AGX Xavier AI compute platform. Our open programmable software defined platform enables Xpeng to run is proprietary software while also delivering over-the-air updates for new driving features and capabilities. Production deliveries of the P7 with NVIDIA DRIVE begin next month.',\n",
       "    'Our Ampere architecture will power our next generation NVIDIA DRIVE platform called Orin, delivering more than six times the performance of Xavier solutions and four times better power efficiency. With Ampere scalability the DRIVE platform will extend from driverless robotaxis all the way down to in-windshield driver assistance systems sipping just a few watts of power. Customers appreciate the top-to-bottom platform all based on a single architecture, letting them build one software-defined platform for every vehicle in their fleet.',\n",
       "    'Lastly in the area of robotics, we announced that BMW Group has selected the new NVIDIA Isaac robotics platforms to automate their factories, utilizing logistic robots built on advanced AI computing and visualization technologies.',\n",
       "    'Turning to Data Center. Quarterly revenue was a record $1.14 billion, up 80% year-on-year and up 18% sequentially, crossing the $1 billion mark for the first time. Announced last week the A100 is the first Ampere architecture GPU. Although just announced, A100 is in full production, contributed meaningful to Q1 revenue and demand is strong. Overall data center demand was solid throughout the quarter. It was also broad based across hyperscale and vertical industry customers as well as across workloads, including training, inference and high-performance computing. We continue to have solid visibility into Q2. The A100 offers the largest leap in performance to date over our eight generations of GPUs boosting performance by up to 20 times over its predecessor. It is exceptionally versatile, serving as a universal accelerator for the most important high performance workloads, including AI training and inference as well as data analytics, scientific computing and cloud graphics.',\n",
       "    \"Beyond its leap performance and versatility, the A100 introduces new elastic computing technologies that make it possible to bring right-size computing power to every job, A multi-instance GPU capability allows each A100 to be partitioned into as many as seven smaller GPU instances. Conversely multiple A100s interconnected by our third generation NVLink can operate as one giant GPU for ever larger training tasks. This makes the A100 ideal for both training and for inference. The A100 will be deployed by the world's leading cloud service providers and system builders, including Alibaba Cloud, Amazon Web Services, Baidu Cloud, Dell Technologies, Google Cloud Platform, HPE and Microsoft Azure among others. It is also getting adopted by several supercomputing centers, including the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center and the Julich Supercomputing Centre in Germany and Argonne National Laboratory. We launched and shipped the DGX A100, our third generation DGX and the most advanced AI system in the world. The DGX A100 is configurable from one to 56 independent GPUs to deliver elastic software defined datacenter infrastructure for the most demanding workloads from AI training and inference to data analytics.\",\n",
       "    'We announced two products for Edge AI, the EGX A100 for larger commercial off-the-shelf servers and EGX Jetson Xavier NX micro-edge servers. Supported by full AI optimized cloud native and secure software the EGX platform is built for AI computing at the edge. With the EGX, hospitals, retail stores, farms and factories can securely carry out real-time processing of the massive amounts of data streaming from trillions of edge sensors. NVIDIA EGX makes it possible to securely deploy and manage and update fleets of servers remotely. EGX is also ideal for the massive computational challenge of 5G networks, which we are working on with our partners like Ericsson and Mavenir.',\n",
       "    \"Additionally, we announced CUDA 11 another important software harnessing the A100's performance and universatility to accelerate three of the most complex and fast-growing workloads, recommendation systems, computational AI and data science. First NVIDIA Merlin is a deep recommendator application framework that enables developers to quickly build state-of-the-art recommendation systems, leveraging our pre-trained models. With billions of users and trillions of items on the Internet deep recommendator are the critical engine powering virtually every Internet service.\",\n",
       "    'Second NVIDIA Jarvis is a GPU accelerated application framework that makes it easy for developers to create, deploy, and run end-to-end real-time conversational AI applications that understand terminology unique to each company and its customers using both vision and speech. Demand for these applications are surging amid the shift to working from home, telemedicine, and remote learning. And third, in the field of data science and data analytics, we announced that we are bringing end-to-end GPU acceleration to Apache Spark, an analytics engine for big data processing that uses more than 500,000 data scientists worldwide. Native GPU acceleration for the entire Spark pipeline from extracting, transforming, and loading the data to training to inference, delivers the performance and the scale needed to finally connect the potential of big data with the power of AI. Adobe has achieved a 7 times performance improvement and a 90% cost savings in an initial test using GPU accelerated data analytics with Spark.',\n",
       "    \"Our accelerated computing platform continues to gain momentum underscored by the tremendous success of GTC Digital, our annual GPU technology conference, which shifted this spring to an online format. More than 55,000 online developers in AI research registered for the online event, which includes hundreds of hours of free content from AI practitioners and industry experts who leverage NVIDIA's platforms. Our ecosystem is now 1.8 million developer strong. Times like these truly test a computing platform's metal in the utility it brings to scientists racing for solutions. Researchers around the world are deploying our GPU computing platform in the fight against COVID-19. Scientists are combining AI simulation to detect changes in pneumonia [Phonetic] cases, sequence the virus, and seek effective bio-molecular compounds for a vaccine or treatment.\",\n",
       "    \"The first breakthrough came from researchers at the University of Texas at Austin and National Institute of Health who used the GPU accelerated application to create the first 3D atomic scale map of the virus using NVIDIA GPUs. This was followed by researchers at Oak Ridge National Laboratory who screened 8,000 compounds to identify 77 promising drug targets using the world's fastest supercomputer Summit, which is powered by more than 27,000 NVIDIA GPUs. The V100 GPUs at Oak Ridge are in high demand as they can analyze 17 million compound protein combinations in a day. To help understand the virus spread pattern, the University of California at San Diego, researchers ported their microbiomic analysis software to GPUs in the San Diego supercomputing cluster of 500 times analysis speed up from what some people are more susceptible to the virus.\",\n",
       "    'Okay, moving to the rest of the P&L. Q1 GAAP gross margins were 65.1% and non-GAAP was 65.8%, up sequentially and year-on-year primarily driven by GeForce GPU product mix and higher data center sales. Q1 GAAP operating expenses were $1.03 billion and non-GAAP operating expenses were $821 million, up 10% and 9% year-on-year respectively. Q1 GAAP EPS was $1.47, up 130% from a year earlier and non-GAAP EPS was $1.80, up 105% from a year ago. Q1 cash flow from operations was $909 million.',\n",
       "    'Before I turn to the outlook, let me make a few comments on our Mellanox acquisition. Beyond the strong strategic and cultural fit that Jensen has discussed, Mellanox has exceptionally strong financial profile. The company reported revenue of $429 million in its March quarter, accelerating to 40% year-on-year growth with GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins in the mid-to-high 60% range. We expect the acquisition to be immediately accretive to non-GAAP gross margins, non-GAAP earnings per share, and free cash flow. We aim to retain the full Mellanox team and accelerate investments in our combined road map as we jointly innovate on our shared vision for the future of accelerated computing.',\n",
       "    'With that, let me turn to the outlook of the second quarter of fiscal 2021, which includes a full quarter contribution from Mellanox. We have assumed in our outlook the potential ongoing impact from COVID-19. We expect our automotive platform sales to be down 40% on a sequential basis and ProViz to decline sequentially. In gaming, while we will likely see ongoing impact from the partial operations or closures of iCafes and retail stores, we expect that to be largely offset by a shift to e-retail channels. Overall, the precise magnitude of the impact is difficult to predict given uncertainties around the reopening of the economy. Overall, we expect second quarter revenue to be $3.65 billion plus or minus 2%. The contribution of Mellanox revenue is likely to be in the low teens percentage range of our total Q2 revenue. We are providing this breakout to help with comparability between Q1 and Q2, but going forward, will become an integrated part of our data center market platform.',\n",
       "    'GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 58.6% and 66% respectively, plus or minus 50 basis points. The sequential decline in GAAP gross margins primarily reflects an increase in acquisition-related costs, most of which are non-reoccurring. GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $1.52 billion and $1.04 billion respectively. A sequential change in GAAP operating expenses reflects an increase in stock-based compensation and acquisition related costs. GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses for the full year are expected to be approximately $5.7 billion and $4.1 billion respectively. For the full year, stock-based compensation and acquisition related costs also influence. GAAP and non-GAAP OI&E are both expected to be an increase of approximately $50 million and $45 million respectively. GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates are both expected to be 9% plus or minus 1% excluding discrete items. Capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $225 million to $250 million. Further financial details are included in the CFO commentary and other information available on our IR website. New this quarter, we have also posted an investor presentation summarizing our results and key highlights.',\n",
       "    \"In closing, let me highlight upcoming events for the financial community. Next Thursday, May 28th, we will webcast a presentation and Q&A with Jensen on our recent product announcements moderated by Evercore. We will also be at Cowen's TMT Conference on May 27th, Morgan Stanley's Cloud Secular Winners Conference on June 1st, BofA's Technology Conference on June 2nd, Needham's Fourth Automotive Technology Conference on June 3rd and NASDAQ Investor Conference on June 16th. Operator, we will now open for questions. Can you please poll for questions please.\",\n",
       "    'Questions and Answers:',\n",
       "    '[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.',\n",
       "    \"Yeah, thanks and congratulations on the solid quarter. Colette, I'm curious of your commentary around visibility in the data center side. That's been [Phonetic] you know, comments over the last couple of quarters, how would you characterize your visibility today relative to maybe what it was last quarter and how do we think about the visibility in the context of trends maybe into the back half of the calendar year. Thank you.\",\n",
       "    'Your next question comes from Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research. Please go ahead.',\n",
       "    'Hi guys, thanks for taking my questions. I first wanted to follow-up on your gaming commentary. You sort of mentioned a couple of offsets, COVID potentially still a headwind, e-tail a tailwind and maybe offsetting each other. Were you trying to suggest that those did offset completely and gaming was kind of flattish into Q2, because I know it has a typical seasonal pattern, switch [Phonetic] is typically up. I guess what were trying to say with those kind of factors and what are the kinds of things we should be thinking about when it comes to seasonality, Colette, into Q2 around that business segment?',\n",
       "    \"That's right.\",\n",
       "    \"Right, some of the pieces that we had seen related to COVID-19 in Q1 may carryover into Q2. COVID-19 in fact had an impact in terms of our retail channels as well as our iCafes. However, as we discussed, it efficiently moved to overall e-tail. We have normally been seasonally down in desktop between Q1 and Q2 and that will likely happen, but we do see the strength in terms of laptops and overall consoles as we move from Q1 to Q2. So in summary, we do expect growth sequentially between Q1 and Q2 for our overall gaming business. Now, I'll turn it over to Jensen to see if he has additional commentary.\",\n",
       "    'No, that was great. That was fantastic.',\n",
       "    \"That's very helpful.\",\n",
       "    \"Stacy, the thing I would add is this, I would say, I think the guidance is exactly what Colette mentioned, but if you look at the big picture, there's a few dynamics that are working really well in our favor. First, of course, is that RTX and ray tracing is just a home run. Minecraft was phenomenal. We have 33 games in the pipe that has already been announced or shipping. Just about every game developer is signed onto RTX and ray tracing and I think it's a forgone conclusion that this is the next generation. This is the way computer graphics are going to be in the future. So I think RTX is a home run.\",\n",
       "    \"Got it. That's helpful. Thank you, guys.\",\n",
       "    'Yeah. Thank you.',\n",
       "    'Your next question comes from Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley.',\n",
       "    'Great, thank you. I wanted to ask about the roll out of Ampere, how quickly does that roll into the various segments between hyperscale as well as on the DGX side as well as on the HPC side and is it a smooth transition, is there, you know, I remember when you launched Volta, there was a little bit of a transitional pause, just can you tell us how you see that ramping up with the different customer segments?',\n",
       "    \"Yeah, thanks a lot Joe. So first of all, taking a step back, accelerated computing is now common sense in data centers. It wasn't the case when we first launched Volta. If you went back to Volta, Volta was the first generation that did deep learning training in a really serious way and it was really focused on training. It was focused on training and high performance computing. We didn't come until later with the inference version called T4, but over the course of the last five years, we've been accelerating workloads that are now diversifying in data centers. If you take a look at most of the hyperscalers, machine learning is now pervasive, deep learning is now pervasive. The notion of accelerating deep learning and machine learning using our GPUs is now common sense. It didn't used to be. People still saw it as something esoteric, but today, data centers all over the world expect a very significant part of their data center being accelerated with GPUs.\",\n",
       "    'Thank you.',\n",
       "    'Yeah, thanks a lot, Joe.',\n",
       "    'Your next question comes from Vivek Arya with Bank of America. Please go ahead.',\n",
       "    'Thanks for taking my question and congratulations on the strong growth and execution. Just a quick clarification, Colette, 66% kind of the new baseline for gross margin.',\n",
       "    \"And then the question Jensen for you is, give us a sense for how much inference as a workload and Ampere as a product are expected to contribute. I'm just curious where you are in terms of growing in the inference and edge AI market and where are we kind of in the journey of Ampere penetration? Thank you.\",\n",
       "    \"We announced three very important partners in three domains and they are the lead partners that we felt that people would know, but we have several hundred partners that are working with us on edge AI. We announced Walmart for smart retail, we announced the US Postal Service, the world's largest mail sorting service and logistics service and then we announced this last quarter, BMW who is working with us to transform their factory into a robotics automated factory in the future. And so these three applications are great examples of the next phase of artificial intelligence and where Ampere is going to ramp into and that is just really at its early, early stages.\",\n",
       "    \"And so I think it's fair to say that we're really well positioned in the two fundamental forces of IT today, data center scale computing and artificial intelligence and the segments that it's going to make a real impact are all gigantic markets, hyperscale AI, cloud and edge AI.\",\n",
       "    'Thank you.',\n",
       "    'Thanks a lot, Vivek.',\n",
       "    'C.J. Muse with Evercore, please go ahead.',\n",
       "    \"Yeah. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. I guess I'm going to ask two. Colette, can you help us with what you think the growth rate for Mellanox could look like in calendar '20? And then Jensen, a bigger picture question for you. And really not specific to healthcare, more broad based, but how do you think about the long-lasting impact of COVID on worldwide demand for AI? Thank you.\",\n",
       "    'C.J., can you help me? You cut out in the middle of your sentence to me. Can you repeat the first part of it for me? Thank you.',\n",
       "    \"Yeah. Sorry about that. I'm curious if you could provide a little handholding on what we should think about for growth for Mellanox in calendar '20.\",\n",
       "    \"At this time it's a little early for us and as you know, we generally just give one quarter out and we're excited to bring the Mellanox team on board, so we can start beginning the future of building products together for the overall [Technical Issues] seen their overall performance over the last couple of quarters. They had a great last year, they had a great March quarter as well and we're just going to have to stay tuned to see equally with them what the second half of the year looks for them. Okay.\",\n",
       "    \"Yeah, C.J. Thanks for the question. This pandemic is really quite tragic and is reshaping industries and markets. And I think it's going to be structural. I think it's going to remain and I think your question is really good because now is a good time to think about where to double down. There is a few areas that I believe are going to be structurally changed. And I think that once I said it will be very sensible.\",\n",
       "    \"The first is that the world's enterprise digital transformation and moving to the cloud that's going to accelerate. Every single company can't afford to rely just on on-prem IT. They have to be much more resilient. And having a hybrid cloud computing infrastructure is going to provide them the resilience they need. And so that's one. And when the world moves and accelerates into this $1 trillion IT infrastructure transformation which is now $100 billion into that journey, it's growing 40% a year, I wouldn't be surprised to see that that accelerate. And so cloud computing AI is going to accelerate because of that.\",\n",
       "    \"And then lastly, I think more and more people are going to work permanently from home. There is a strong movement of those companies that are going to support a larger percentage of people working from home. And when people are working from home it's going to clearly increase the single best home entertainment, which is video games. I think video games is going to represent a much larger segment of the overall entertainment budget of society. And so these are some of the trends I would say. I would say, cloud computing, AI, I would say national labs, a computational defense system, robotics and working from home are structural changes that are going to be here to stay and these dynamics are really good for us.\",\n",
       "    'Your next question comes from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.',\n",
       "    \"Thanks Toshiya for your question. So regarding our gross margins in the second quarter, our second quarter guide at 66% is up sequentially from even a record level in terms of what we had in terms of Q1. This next record that we hope to achieve with our overall guidance is even with including our overall Ampere architecture. So typically when we transition to new architectures margins can somewhat be a little bit lower on the on-track potential kind of move up and trend up over time. Additionally, as you articulated, our automotive is lower, but also we're going to see growth in some of our platforms in gaming such as consoles which may offset those two.\",\n",
       "    \"But overall, there's nothing structural to really highlight other than our mix in business and the ramp of Ampere and its transition.\",\n",
       "    \"So Toshiya, let me respond to your second question that you had for me, which was regarding to our opex and our decision to pull forward our overall struggle [Phonetic] into Q2. This is something that we've normally done later in the year. We felt it was prudent during the current COVID-19. Although our employees are quite safe, we just wanted to make sure that their family members also were safe and have the opportunity to have cash upfront. It is about a couple of months, about four months earlier than normal and it is incorporated in our guidance for Q2.\",\n",
       "    'Your next question comes from Mark Lipacis with Jefferies. Please go ahead.',\n",
       "    \"And then the third thing is it's the first GPU ever, the first acceleration platform ever that's elastic. You can reconfigure it, you could configure it for either scale up or you can configure it for scale out. When you configure it for scale up, you gang a whole bunch of GPUs together using NVLink and it creates this one gigantic GPU. When you want to scale it out, that same computation node becomes 56 small GPUs and each one of those 56 small GPUs, each one of those 56 partitions, each one is more powerful than Volta. I mean it's really quite extraordinary. And so, Ampere is a breakthrough on all of these fronts for performance, for the fact that it unifies the workload and you can now have one acceleration cluster, and the number three, it's elastic. You can use it in the cloud, you can use it for inference, you can use it for training and so the versatility of Ampere is the thing that I'm most excited about and now you could have one acceleration cluster that serves all of your needs.\",\n",

       "    'Your next question comes from Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Please go ahead.',\n",
       "    \"Thanks a lot. Actually I had two, I guess Jensen, first for you. Just on the data center business, things have been very strong recently, obviously there's always concerns that customers are pulling in capex, but it sounds like you have pretty good visibility into July, but I guess last time most folks also thought that you're kind of attrition [Phonetic] was so low that you would be immune to any digestion, but that wasn't the case. I guess I'm wondering, things are different now with A100 and what not, but my question is, how do you handicap your ability to this time maybe get through any digestion on the capex side and then I guess second question, Colette, stock comp had been running like $220 million [Phonetic] a quarter and the guidance implies that it goes to like $460 million [Phonetic] a quarter. So it goes up a lot. Is that all executive retention and is that sort of the right level as you look into 2021? Thanks.\",\n",
       "    'Sure. So let me help you on the overall GAAP adjustments. So the delta between our GAAP opex and our non-GAAP opex. If you look at it for the full year and what we guided, we probably have about $1.55 billion associated with GAAP level expenses. Keep in mind, there is more in there than just our stock-based compensation. We have also incorporated the accounting that we will do for the overall Mellanox and a really good portion of those costs are associated with the amortization of intangibles and also in terms of acquisition-related costs and deal fees and one-time items. So our stock-based compensation includes what we need for NVIDIA and also the onboarding of Mellanox. There is some retention with the overall onboarding of Mellanox, but for the most part, it is just working them in to the year for three quarters which is influencing the stock-based compensation.',\n",

Jensen, can you [Phonetic] show the importance of networking, networking fabric and the Mellanox acquisition, right, for example, when you guys moved from virtual DGX-1 to virtual DGX-2, [Indecipherable] the GPU chipset but by adding a custom networking fabric chip and more Mellanox network interface cards, among other things you guys drove a pretty significant improvement in performance for GPU. But now when we think about scaling out compute acceleration to data center scaled implementation, how does Mellanox and Ethernet switching platforms differ from those provided by other large networking OEMs, some of whom have been your long-term partners? And then how does the Cumulus acquisition fit into the switching and networking strategy as well?',\n",

       "    \"All right. Thank you for taking my question. Jensen, I'd like to focus on something you said I think it was in one of your earlier responses. You said something about a very significant part of data centers are now accelerated with GPUs. I'm sort of curious how to interpret that. If we think about sort of the evolution of compute architecture going from almost entirely let's say, racks and racks of GPUs to some future day where we have many more accelerators and maybe a much smaller number of of CPUs relative to those. Maybe you can talk to us about where we are in terms of that architectural shift and where you think it goes sort of longer term, where we are in the position of that?\",\n",
       "    \"It's the most important model because it's the only way that you and I could use the Internet in any reasonable way, it is the only way that you and I could use a shopping website or a video web or a video app or a music app or a book or news or anything and so it is the engine of the Internet from the consumers' perspective. From the company's perspective, it is the engine of commerce. Without the recommender system, there is no way they could possibly make money and so their accuracy in predicting user preferences is core to everything they do. You just go up and down the list of every company and that engine is gigantic, it is just a gigantic engine and from the data processing part of it, which is the reason why we went and spent three years on Spark and RAPIDS, which made Spark possible and all the work that we did on NVLink and all that stuff was really focused on big data analytics.\",\n",
       "    \"The second is all of the training of the deep learning models and then inference. So the number of applications, the footprint of accelerated computing has grown tremendously and its importance has grown tremendously, because the applications are the most important applications of these companies and so I think when I mentioned, when I said that that acceleration is still growing, it is, but the major workloads, the most important workloads of the world's most important companies solidly require acceleration and so I'm looking forward to a really exciting ramp for Ampere for all of the reasons that I've just mentioned.\",\n",
       "    'Your next question comes from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.',\n",
       "    \"Yeah, hi guys. Thanks for letting me ask the question. Just two quick ones. Colette, I hate to ask something as mundane as opex, but just given the full year guide, there's sort of a lot to unpack and you talked about some of it like the raises. I mean, I think you also probably have some COVID plus or minuses in that. I think there is an extra week this year as well. And then, of course, there is Mellanox and how you're thinking about investing in that asset. I guess I'm just kind of curious, when we look at the full year guide, is there something structural going on, on opex as you try to take advantage of all these opportunities or can we use it as sort of a guidepost to how you're thinking about revenue for the back half of the year as well. How do I understand that and then Jensen, just a quick one for you, kind of makes sense to me that COVID is accelerating activity in sort of HPC and hyperscale and maybe even in certain verticals like healthcare, but in the other verticals as the sort of the shelter-in-place kind of hurt engagement and could we actually come out of Covid with some pent-up demand in those vertical markets?\",\n",
       "    \"Okay. Thanks, John for the question. Let's start from the first perspective on the overall opex for the year. We've guided the non-GAAP at approximately $4.1 billion for the year. Yes, that incorporates three full quarters of Mellanox, Mellanox and its employees, we have about close to 3,000 Mellanox employees coming on board. You are correct, we have a 53rd week in this quarter, excuse me, not this quarter, this year and that has been outlined in our SEC filings that you should expect that as well. We pulled forward a little bit our focal by several months in order to take care of our employees. And then lastly, though we are investing in our business, we see some great opportunities. You've seen some great results from our investment and there is more to do. We are hiring and investing in those businesses. So there is nothing different structurally but just this onset of Mellanox and are investing together I think we'll produce long-term great results.\",\n",
       "    \"And as usual, John, you know that we're investing into the IT industry's largest opportunities: cloud computing and AI. And then after these two opportunities is edge AI. And so we're looking down the fairway with some pretty extraordinary opportunities, but as usual, we're thoughtful about the rate of investment and we're well managed and NVIDIA's leadership team are excellent managers and and you could count on us to continue to do that. Hey, Simona, what was John's question? Could you just give me one hint. I have it at the tip of my hand.\",\n",
       "    'Just the idea of engagement levels in verticals just with shelter-in-place, has that hampered [Speech Overlap].',\n",
       "    \"So I think the future of autonomous vehicles is a certainty. People recognize the incredible economics that the pioneer Tesla is enjoying and the industry is going to go after it. The future car companies are going to be software-defined companies and technology companies and they would love to have an economic that allows them to enjoy the installed base of their fleets and so they are going to go after it. I am certain that this is going to come back and I have every confidence its going to come back. And let's see, the energy sectors have been impacted, the retail sector has been impacted. Those aren't large industries for us, but nonetheless, they are impacted. The impact in some of the industries is accelerating their focus in robotics. Like for example, on the one hand, BMW's has obviously impacted in manufacturing, which is the reason why they're moving so rapidly toward robotics. They have to figure out a way to get robotics into their factories. The same thing with retail. You're going to see a lot more robotics support in retail, you're going to see a lot more robotics support in warehouses, in logistics, and so during this time when the market when the industry is disrupted and impacted, it allows the market leaders to really lean into investing into the future and so when they come back, they'll be coming back stronger than ever.\",\n",

Where computing and networking go hand-in-hand, the acquisition of Mellanox gives us deep expertise and scale to innovate from end-to-end. Second, AI is the most powerful technology force of our time. Our Ampere generation offers several breakthroughs. It is the largest ever generational leap, 20 times in training and inference throughput, the first unified acceleration platform for data analytics, machine learning, deep learning, training and inference, and the first elastic accelerator that can be configured for scale up applications like training to scale out applications like inference. Ampere is fast, it's universal, and it's elastic. It's going to rearchitect the modern data center. Third, we're opening large new markets with AI software application frameworks such as Clara for healthcare, DRIVE for autonomous vehicles, Isaac for robotics, Jarvis for conversational AI, Metropolis for edge IoT, Aerial for 5G and Merlin with the very important recommender systems.

Full-year fiscal year '20 datacenter revenue was a record $2.98 billion, up 2% from the prior year. Strong growth was fueled by hyperscale, and vertical industry and customers. Hyperscale demand was driven by purchases of both our training and inference products in support of key AI workloads, such as natural language understanding, conversational AI and deep recommendators.

       "    \"And between the items, the people, the users and the various contexts that we're in, location and what you're looking for, and weather or what's happening in the environment. Those kind of contexts affects the search query, the answer they provide you. The recommendation system is just foundational now to search. And some people have said this is the end of search in the beginning and the era of recommendation systems. Work is being done everywhere around the world in advancing recommendation systems. And very first time, over the last year it's been able to be done in deep learning.\",\n",
       "    \"And so, the first thing is just the breakthroughs in AI. The second is production AI, which means that whereas we had significant, and we continue to have significant opportunities in training, because of the models getting larger and there are more of them, we're seeing a lot of these models going into production, and that business is called inference. Inference, as Colette mentioned, grew four times year-over-year, it's a substantial part of our business now. But one of the interesting statistics is TensorRT7, the entire TensorRT download this year was about 500,000, a doubling over a year ago. What most people don't understand about inference is, it's an incredibly complex computational problem, but it's an enormously complex software problem.\",\n",
       "    \"And so the second dynamic is, moving from training or growing from training and models going into production called inference. The third is the growth, not just in hyperscale anymore, but in public cloud and in vertical industries. Public cloud because of thousands of AI start-ups that are now developing AI software in the cloud, and the opex model works much better for them as they're younger. When they become larger, they could decide to build their own data center infrastructure on-prem, but the thousands of start-ups start their lives in the cloud.\",\n",
       "    \"And then, the last dynamic is being talked about a lot, and this is really, really exciting, and it's called edge AI. We used to call it industries and AI where the action is, but the industry now calls it edge AI. We're seeing a lot of excitement there. And the reason for that is, you need to have low latency inference, you might not be able to stream the data all the way to the cloud for cost reasons or data sovereignty reasons, and you need the response time. And so those four dynamics around AI really drove our growth.\",\n",

Now that you have the perspective of seeing what's driving the rebound. Any thoughts on what drove it to slow down in the first place? Was it just digestion? Was it sort of a hand off from image recognition to these newer applications that you just talked about? Just help us what happened there.

Similar to what we had seen last quarter, with all things growing as we moved into this quarter, growth in terms of the hyperscales, continued expansion in terms of those vertical industries, and even in the cloud instances, we're still looking at around the same split of 50-50 between our hyperscales and our vertical industries and maybe a little bit tad below 50 in terms of our total overall hyperscales.\",\n",

When I look at the numbers, the growth on an absolute basis sequentially in data center was almost two times or north of two times is what we've seen in the past as far as the absolute sequential change. Through the course of this quarter, you were pretty clear that you would expect to see an acceleration of growth in the December quarter. I'm just curious of how you think about that going into the April quarter? And how we should think about that growth rate through the course of this year? If you can give us any kind of framework.\",\n",

       "    \"And if you go back and think about all the questions that have been asked of me over the last three or four years around this area, the consistency of the answer has to do with the programmability of architecture, the richness of the software, the difficulties of the compilers, the ever-growing size of the models, the diversity of the models and the advances that these models are creating. And so, we're seeing the beginning of a new computing era. And a fixed function accelerator is simply not the right answer. And so, we believe that the future is going to be accelerated. It's going to require an accelerated computing platform, and software richness is really vital so that these data centers could be software defined.\",\n",

But on the partnership with Tencent on cloud gaming, seems like Tencent should have a smoother transition to the cloud model. They are the largest gaming company in the world. So they own many of the games. They also have their own data center infrastructure already in place, but how is the NVIDIA team going to be supporting this partnership.

If I look at your overall revenue guide, it would seem to suggest that you're looking for, typically, I guess, better seasonal trends into April? And I guess, can you speak to that? And then, how are you seeing desktop gaming demand with increasing content becoming more available. How should we think about the growth trajectory through 2020? And then, just really as a modeling question as part of gaming, with notebook now as third of the revenues, how should we think about kind of the seasonality going into April and July for that part of your business?

So with that from a background, and you think about all those different components that are within gaming, the notebook, the overall Switch and, of course, all of the ray tracing that we have in terms of desktop. Our normal seasonality, as we look at Q1 for gaming with all those three pieces is usually sequentially down from Q4. Sequentially down Q4 to Q1.

Historically, NVIDIA had essentially all of the training market and little of the inference market. In the last year-and-a-half or so, I think, that's changed, where you've done much better in inference. Now you have the T4 in the cloud, you have EGX at the Edge, and you have Jetson, I think is what it's called, at the sort of endpoint device. How do you anticipate that market for inference developing across those various positions? And how are you aligning your portfolio for that growth?\",\n",

And then secondarily, conversational AI and latency sensitive models and applications where our GPUs are essential, now moving forward. I think you're going to see a lot more opportunities for us in inference. The way to think about that long term is, acceleration is essential because of end of Dennard scaling. Process technology is going to reap [Phonetic] demand that we compute in a different way.

That in turn is driving demand for our GPUs on two fronts; first, these models are massive and highly complex. They have 10x to 20x, in some cases, 100x more parameters than image-based models.

       "    \"Thank you for taking my question. For my first one, you mentioned that you were seeing strong sequential growth in the data center going into Q4. Jensen, I was wondering if you could give us some color on what's driving that? And just how you think about the sustainability of data center growth going into next year and what markets do you think will drive that, is it more enterprise, more hyperscalers, more HPC, just some color on near and longer-term on data center? And then I had a follow-up for Colette.\",\n",
       "    \"Whereas, images could be done offline, conversation has to be done in real time. And without acceleration and without NVIDIA's accelerators, it's really not possible to do it in real time, it takes seconds to process all of the handful of deep learning models. And now we're able to do that on an accelerator and do it in real time.\",\n",
       "    'And so the combination of these various breakthroughs from deep learning based recommender, the speech stack, as well as natural language understanding breakthrough in what is called the bidirectional encoded transformer. That breakthrough is really quite significant and since then derivative works have come from that approach and natural language understanding is really working incredibly well.',\n",
       "    \"And so what we're seeing people do is the hyperscalers across the world we work with just about everybody, this area of work is really complicated, the models are very, very large. There's a whole bunch of models that has to work together and they are getting larger. And so that's one large category, which is the hyperscalers.\",\n",
       "    \"The second which we introduced this quarter is really about taking AI out to the edge. And the reason for that is because there are many applications whether it's based on video or other types of sensors of all kinds where there is vibration sensors, temperature sensors. bio-metrics sensors, there's all kinds of sensors that are used in industries to monitor the health of equipment, monitor the conditions of various situations and you want to do the processing at the point of action. This way you don't stream [Phonetic] the data, which is continuous back into the cloud, which caused a lot of money. You want to take the action at the point of action because latency matters, maybe you're controlling gates or vehicles or robots or drones or whatnot, and then lastly, one major issue is data sovereignty.\",\n",
       "    'And just another quick follow-up, on PC gaming, how are you looking at growth going forward. In that you had a very good quarter in October, I think in January you are probably guiding to some seasonal declines, but I imagine a lot more of that is due to console declines, just how are you looking at PC gaming growth going into October into January and then next year as you get competition from two new consoles that are also supposed to come out. Thank you.',\n",
       "    \"Overall, for PC gaming and RTX is doing fantastic, let me tell you why it's so important, I would say that at this point, I think, it's fairly clear that ray tracing is the future and our RTX is a home run. Just about every major game developer has signed on to ray tracing even the next generation consoles have to stutter step and include ray tracing in their next generation consoles.\",\n",
       "    \"The effects, the photo realistic look, is just so compelling. It's not possible to really go back anymore. And so I think that it's fairly clear now that RTX ray tracing is the future. And there are several 100 million PC gamers in the world that don't have the benefits of it, and I'm looking forward to upgrading them.\",\n",
       "    \"Second, and this is a combination of RTX and Max-Q, we really created a brand new game platform, notebook PC gaming. Notebook PC gaming really didn't exist until Max-Q came along and our second-generation Max-Q this last season really turbocharge this segment. Over 100 laptops now are available for PC gaming. And my sense is that this is likely going to be the largest gaming platform, new gaming platform that emerges. And we're just in the beginning innings of that.\",\n",
       "    \"And so the combination of upgrading the entire installed base of PC gamers to RTX and ray tracing and this new gaming segment called notebook PC gaming is really quite exciting and it's going to drive our continued growth for some time and so I'm excited about that.\",\n",

Just thinking about the trajectory of gross margin here, solid gross margin upside in the quarter, you also noted that you have the benefit of selling through some written-off component. So,I guess, first question is, what was that impact in this most recent reported quarter and how do we think about the trajectory of gross margin here even beyond the January quarter, what should we be thinking about in terms of that gross margin trend and again I have a quick follow-up.',\n",

What underpins your improved visibility or what are you seeing in that piece of your business?\",\n",
       "    \"And the reason for that is because it's far more than just a chip. The software stack that sits on top of the chip and the compilers that sits on top of the chip are so complicated. And it's understandably complicated because a supercomputer wrote the software. And this body of software is really, really large and if you have to make it make it both accurate as well as perform it, it's really a quite a great challenge and it's one of the great computer science challenges. This is one of those problems that hasn't been solved and we've been working hard at it for last six, seven years now.\",\n",

So, clearly, your commentary Jensen here is much more bullish than I've heard you I think before on inference, particularly as it relates to this first benchmark. And so, I guess, can you talk a bit about how you see mix within data center looking out over the next 12 to 24 months. As you'd see kind of training versus inference as well as cloud versus enterprise considering, I would think inference over time could be could grow into a large opportunity there as well.\",\n",
       "    \"Yeah, C.J., that's really good. Let me break it down. So, when we think about hyperscale there are three parts; training, inference and public cloud. Training, you might have seen the work that was done open AI [Phonetic] recently where they have been measuring and monitoring the amount of computation necessary to train these large models. These large models are not only getting larger. The amount of data necessary therefore has to scale as well. The computation is now growing and doubling every three months. And the reason for that is because of recent breakthroughs in natural language understanding and all of a sudden a whole wave of problems are now able to be solved.\",\n",
       "    \"And just as AlexNet, seven years ago kind of was the watershed event for a lot of computer vision oriented AI work. Now, the transformer-based natural language understanding model and the work that Google did with BERT really is a watershed event also for natural language understanding. This is, of course, a much, much harder problem and so the scale of the training has grown tremendously. I think, what we're going to see this year is a fair number of very sizable installations of us of [Phonetic] GPU systems to do this very thing, training.\",\n",
       "    \"The second part is an untapped market for us and this untapped market is really inference. The reason why I haven't really spoken about it until now is because we've never really been able to validate our intuition that that inference is going to be a large market opportunity for us, that it's going to be very complicated the models are very large, they're very diverse, they require large amount of computation, large amount of memory bandwidth and large amounts of memory and large and significant capabilities of programmability.\",\n",
       "    \"And then finally, our business results also validated the our intuition. And so our engagement now with CSPs are now global, we're working across natural language understanding, recommendation systems conversational AI, just a whole bunch of really interesting problems.\",\n",
       "    'And your next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur with JPMorgan.',\n",
       "    'Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. There are a lot of concerns around China, trade tensions, economic slowdown, but history has shown that gamers tend to be less sensitive to these macro trends, and in fact, also somewhat insensitive to price changes, at least at the enthusiast level. So, given that China is such a big part of the gaming segment, can you just discuss the gaming demand trends out of this geography?',\n",
       "    \"Gaming is solid in China and is also the fastest adopter of our gaming notebooks. This gaming RTX notebooks or GeForce notebooks is really a brand new category. This category never existed before because we couldn't get the technology in there. So that it's both delightful to own as well as a powerful to enjoy.\",\n",
       "    'And so we saw a really great success with RTX notebooks and GeForce notebooks in China and RTX adoption has been fast your. Your comments makes sense because most of the games are free to play these days. The primary games that people play are eSports, which you want the best gear, but you could. And after you buy the gear you pretty much enjoy forever and mobile which is largely free to play, you invest in invest in some of your own personal outfits and after that I think you can enjoy for quite a long time. And so the gear is the gear is really important.',\n",

       "    'And your next question comes from the line of Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs.',\n",
       "    'Yeah. Toshiya, let me address the first question regarding our legacy infotainment systems and our auto [Phonetic] business, it is still representing maybe about half or more of our overall revenue in the automotive business. We have our AI cockpit continuing to grow and grow quite well both sequentially as well as year-over-year as well as our autonomous vehicle solutions that we may be doing including development services.',\n",
       "    \"Our focus, our strategy consists of several areas, one area of course is passenger owned vehicles. The second part is robotaxis, we have developments going with just about every major robotaxi company that we know of. And they are here in the States, they are in Europe, they are in China. And when you hear news of them, we're delighted to see the progress. And then the third part has to do with trucks, shuttles and increasingly a large number of vehicles that don't carry people, they carry goods.\",\n",
       "    \"And so we have a major development with Volvo, that was Volvo Trucks, Volvo Cars and Volvo Trucks, as you know, are two different companies, one of them belongs to Giles Volvo Cars, Volvo Trucks is the heritage Volvo. And we have a major program going with them to automate the delivery of goods. You also see us we're doing various GTCs, I'll mention companies are working with on grocery delivery or goods delivery or within a warehouse product delivery. You're going to see a whole bunch of things like that, because the technology is very similar and it's starting to the development, the technology we develop for passenger owned vehicles is starting to propagate down into logistics vehicles.\",\n",
       "    \"I continue to believe that everything that moves eventually will have autonomous capability or be fully autonomous. And that I think is at this point fairly certain. Our strategy is both in developing the in-car AV computing system and it's software defined, it's scalable as well as the AI development and simulation systems. And so when somebody is working on AV and they're using AI and most of them are, there is a great opportunity for us. And when they start ramping up, and they're collecting miles of data, it becomes a very large market opportunity for us.\",\n",
       "    \"And so I'm anxious to see every single car company be as progressive and aggressive in developing AV and they will be, this is a forgone conclusion.\",\n",

       "    'Your next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein.',\n",
       "    \"Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I have two data center questions for Colette. The first question I want to return to your kind of outlook for a strong sequential data center growth in Q4. Now, this business grew 11% sequentially in Q3 and you didn't actually call out strong growth as we were going into the quarter, you are calling out for Q4, does that suggest to me that you expect sequential growth in Q4 to be stronger than Q3, given you're calling it out in Q4, you didn't call it out in Q3 or would you define like what you saw in Q3 as well as already being strong sequential growth, like how do we think about the wording of that in relation to what we've seen in Q3, and what you expect for Q4?\",\n",
       "    'Sure. Stacy, when we had provided guidance in Q3 and how we finished the quarter in Q3, we had indicated that our growth would stem from both gaming and data center. We completed that and we also had stronger than expected from guidance from both gaming and data center in our Q3 results.',\n",
       "    'Moving to Q4, Q4 see sequential decrease in totality versus Q3. We have reminded the teams about our overall seasonality that we sometimes have in gaming associated with our game tools [Phonetic] as well as also with our notebooks that seem to be primarily in Q2 and Q3 being our strongest quarters. And likely therefore a seasonal down tick as we [Phonetic] move to Q4. What we wanted to do was, if we have in totality overall decline associated with that we did want to emphasize what we are expecting in terms of data center with the overall strong growth sequentially.',\n",
       "    'So, I guess, to ask the question again, would you define what you saw in Q3 as being strong growth as well?',\n",
       "    \"I would believe our growth of 17% was higher than we expected to Q3. Again, when we get into Q4 we'll see how the quarter ends in terms of data center, but we are expecting strong growth. Thanks, Stacy.\",\n",
       "    \"Okay. Thank you. For my second question, hyperscale you said was up year-over-year now and that's after off of last year where it was the peak, inference doubled year-over-year. And this suggest to me, I know you said enterprise was down year-over-year. But this suggest to me that it wasn't just down year-over-year, it was down a lot year-over-year. How do we think about that in the context of like the growth that we've seen very strongly over the last few quarters, enterprise. And going back to your commentary at the Analyst Day, which was almost entirely about the opportunity coming from enterprise growth, what's going on there. What drove that and what should we expect going forward?\",\n",
       "    \"Sure. Our enterprise business has been beginning to ramp over a year ago at a very small base. We've continued to see great traction in there with a lot of the things that we've announced throughout, but keep in mind, in our year-ago quarter we also had very strong systems and a very large deal associated with our DGX. So, when we look from a quarter-over-quarter period we're just looking at one quarter we can't have a little bit of lumpiness. So, that year-over-year impact is really just due to a extremely large deal in the prior year Q3.\",\n",
       "    'Your next question comes from the line of Mitch Steves with RBC.',\n",
       "    \"And so the comment that Colette just made comparing to year-over-year, we had a large DGX system sale a year ago that we didn't have this year. But if you excluded that the V100 and the T4 is doing great. There are record levels and T4 didn't hardly existed a year ago now is selling more than V100s and both of them are record highs. And so that kind of gives you a feeling for it. I think, and that's really the major difference, the inference influence is really kicking into gear and my sense is that it's going to continue to grow quite nicely.\",\n",

I apologize for the background noise, but Colette maybe you could give us an idea of gaming and the guidance, it's down and I was wondering could you maybe give us the impact of the console business versus the laptop and give us an idea of what might be the bigger driver there?\",\n",
       "    \"I'd say, our Q4, both of them are expected to be seasonally down. In the case of the consoles, we do wait for Nintendo to assist in terms of what they need, so we will have to see how the quarter ends on that.

Starting with our gaming business, revenue of $1.31 billion was down 27% year-on-year and up 24% sequentially. We are pleased with the strong sequential growth in the quarter, when we launched our RTX Super lineup for desktop gamers, ramped up our greatest ever number of gaming laptops and launched our new RTX Studio laptops for creators.',\n",
       "    'In July, we unveiled three GeForce RTX Super GPUs delivering the best in class gaming performance and power efficiency and real-time ray tracing for both current and next generation games. These GPUs deliver a performance boost of up to 24% from our initial Turing GPUs launched a year earlier. The Super line up strengthens our leadership in the high end of the market and the response has been great. We look forward to delighting gamers with the best performance in ray tracing as we get into the back-to-school and holiday shopping seasons.',\n",

Excitement around these titles is tremendous. GameSpot called Cyberpunk, one of the most anticipated games of the decade',\n",
       "    'NVIDIA GeForce RTX are the only graphic cards in the market with hardware support for ray tracing. They deliver a 2 times to 3 times performance speed up over GPUs without a dedicated ray tracing core.

       "    'The combination of our energy efficient Turing architecture and Max-Q technology enables beautifully crafted thin and light form factors that can deliver the performance of a high-end gaming desktop or a next generation console. At Computex in May, we unveiled NVIDIA RTX Studio laptops, a new design artist platform that extends our reach to the large underserved market of creators. In the age of YouTube, creators and freelancers are rapidly growing population but they have traditionally not had access to professional grade workstations through online and retail channels.',\n",

Powered by our RTX GPUs and Optimus [Phonetic] software, RTX Studio laptops deliver performance that's up to seven times faster than that of the MacBook Pro. A total of 27 RTX Studio models have been announced by major OEMs. Sequential growth also benefited from the production ramp of the two new models of Nintendo Switch gaming console. We expected our console business to remain strong in Q3 before the seasonal production slow down in Q4, when console related revenue is expected to be fairly minimal, similar to last year.\",\n",
       "    'Moving to data center, revenue was $655 million, down 14% year-on-year and up 3% sequentially. In the vertical industries portion of the business, expanding AI workloads drove sequential and year-over-year growth. In hyperscale portion, we continue to be impacted by relatively weak overall spending as a handful of CSPs. Sales of NVIDIA GPUs for use in the cloud were solid while sales for internal hyperscales use were muted, the engineering focus on AI is growing. Let me give some color on each of these areas.',\n",
       "    \"We are building a broad base of customers across multiple industries as they adopt NVIDIA's platforms to harness the power of AI, public sectors, higher education and financial services were among the key verticals driving growth this quarter. In addition, we won Lighthouse account deals in important industries that are on the cusp of being transformed by AI. For example, in retail, Walmart is using NVIDIA GPUs to run some of its product demand forecasting models slashing the time to do so in just four [Phonetic] hours from several weeks on CPUs. By accelerating its data science workflow, Walmart can improve its algorithms, reduce development cycles and test new features.\",\n",
       "    'We are working with Microsoft as an early adopter of these advances. AI computing leadership is a high priority for NVIDIA. Last month, we set records for training deep learning neural network models on the latest MLPerf benchmarks, particularly in the most demanding areas.

       "    \"All in, our ecosystem of developers is now 1.4 million strong. In setting these MLPerf records, we leveraged our new DGX SuperPOD AI supercomputer, demonstrating that leadership in AI research demands leadership in computing infrastructure. This system debuted in June at Number 22 on the top 500 list of the world's fastest supercomputers at the Annual International Supercomputing Conference, used to meet the massive demand of our autonomous vehicle development program. It is powered by more than 1500 NVIDIA V100 Tensor Core GPUs linked with Mellanox interconnects. We've made DGX SuperPOD available commercially to customers. Essentially, providing them with a turnkey supercomputer that they can assemble in weeks rather than months. It is roughly 400 times smaller in size than other similarly performing top 500 systems, which are built from thousands of servers. Also at the conference, we announced that by next year's end, we will make available to the Arm ecosystem, NVIDIA's full stack of AI and HPC software which accelerates more than 600 HPC applications and all AI frameworks. With this announcement, NVIDIA will accelerate all major CPU architectures including x86, POWER and Arm. Lastly, regarding our pending acquisition of Mellanox, we have received regulatory approval in the US and are engaged with regulators in Europe and China. The approval process is progressing as expected and we continue to work toward closing the deal by the end of this calendar year.\",\n",
       "    \"Moving to pro visualization. Revenue reached $291 million, up 4% from a prior year and up 9% sequentially. Year-on-year and sequential growth was led by record revenue from mobile workstations with strong demand for new thing and light form factors.

How should we think about your outlook into the October quarter vis-a-vis kind of normal seasonality. How are you thinking about switch within that and considering now that you have full Turing line up as well as content truly coming to the forefront here. How do you think about trends beyond the October quarter? Thank you.',\n",

       "    'Sure. From a gaming perspective, the overall switch or the overall console business definitely is a seasonal business, we usually expect to see production ramping in Q2 and in Q3 with it coming down likely in Q4. So you should see switch to be a portion definitely of our gaming business in Q3.',\n",

       "    \"Great. So let me start first with your question. Vivek, regarding gross margins. Yes , thanks for recognizing that we are moving toward our expectations that over time, we'll continue to see our overall growth [Phonetic] volumes improve. Essentially our businesses is normalized. We've reached normalized levels through the last couple of quarters and this quarter, just very similar to what we will see going forward as mix is the largest driver of what drives our overall gross margins and our gross margin improvement.\",\n",
       "    \"Our computing architecture is really ideal for it. AI is not just one network, it's thousands of different types of networks and these networks are getting more and more complex over time, the amount of data you have to process is enormous. And so like all software programs, you can't predict exactly how the software is going to get programed and having a programmable architecture like CUDA, and yet optimized for AI like Tensor Cores that we created is really the ideal architecture. We know also that AI is the most powerful technology force of our time, the ability for machines to learn and write software by itself and write software that no humans can right is pretty extraordinary and the applications of AI as you guys are watching yourself are just spreading in every single industry.\",\n",
       "    \"The next phase of AI is what we call vertical industry enterprise AI. And this is where companies are using it, not just to accelerate, the business process internally, but they're using AI to create new products and services. They could be new medical instruments to IoT based medical instruments to monitor your health, it could be something related to an application that you use for financial services for forecasting or for fraud detection, it could be some kind of device that delivers pizza to you, delivery bots. And the combination of IoT and artificial intelligence, for the very first time, you actually have the software capabilities to make use of all of the sensors that you're putting all over the world and that's the next phase of growth.\",\n",
       "    \"And it effects companies from large industrials, transportation companies, retailers, you name it, healthcare companies, you name it.

Jensen, you guys called out inference as a significant contributor to growth in data center last quarter. I think, you guys talked about it being a double-digit percentage contributor. Curious, what you saw from inference in the quarter and more importantly, if you can talk about the outlook both near term and long term. As it relates to inference that will be helpful.',\n",

There are many types of applications, where because of the laws of physics reasons, the speed light reasons or the economics reasons or data sovereignty reasons. It's not possible to stream the data to the cloud and have the inference done at the cloud. You have to do that at the edge. You need the latency to be low, the amount of data that you are streaming is continuous, and so you don't want to be paying for that line rate the whole time and maybe the data is of great confidentiality or privacy. And so we're seeing a lot of excitement and a lot of development for edge AI, smart retail, smart warehouses, smart factories, smart cities, smart airports, you just make a list of those kind of things. Basically locations, where there is a lot of activity, where safety or cost or a large amount of materials is passing through, you could just imagine the applications. All of those really want to be edge computing systems and edge inference systems.\",\n",
       "    \"So to answer your question regarding gross margin in a little bit more detail. Probably our largest area that we expect improvement in terms of our mix is our mix return regarding our overall gaming business. We expect to have a full quarter of our SUPER lineup within the next quarter, including our RTX as well as our notebook becoming a bigger mix as well as it grows. These drivers are one of the largest reasons where we see that growth in our gross margin. We always think about our component cost, our overall cost of manufacturing. So this is always baked in that over time. But we'll continue to see improvements on that as well.\",\n",

Many of your peers on the compute and storage side are seeing spending recovery by cloud and hyperscalers in the second half of this year after a similar weak first half of the year. You guys saw some growth in Q2, driven primarily by enterprise, it seems like you have some broadening out of the customer spending this quarter, inferencing continues to see strong momentum.

Do you see signs of demand maybe building up ahead of the new seven nanometer product, whenever that comes out. I guess, I'm just wondering whether there is some element of this is more around product cadence that gets resolved as you do roll out the new product. That's the first question. And then I guess, the second question, Colette is of the $300 million growth into October. It sounds like switch is pretty flat, but I'm wondering, if you can give us maybe some qualitative sense of where the growth is coming from, is it maybe like two third gaming and one third data center, something like that.

The software stack at Xilinx is progressing with Versal ACAP.

Starting with our gaming business: Revenue of $1.05 billion was down 39% year-on-year and up 11% sequentially, consistent with our expectations. We are pleased with the initial ramp of Turing and the reduction of inventory in the channel. During the quarter, we filled out our Turing lineup with the launch of midrange GeForce products that enable us to delight gamers with the best performance at every price point, starting at $149. New product launches this quarter included the GeForce GTX 1660 Ti, 1660 and 1650, which bring Turing to the high-volume PC gaming segment for both desktop and laptop. These GPUs deliver up to 50% performance improvement over their Pascal-based predecessors, leveraging new Shader innovations such as concurrent floating point and integer operations, a unified cache and adaptive shading, all with the incredibly power-efficient architecture.',\n",

       "    \"Finally, turning to Automotive; Q1 revenue was $166 million, up 14% from a year ago and up 2% sequentially. Year-on-year growth was driven by growing adoption of next-generation AI cockpit solutions and autonomous vehicle development deals. At GTC, we had major customer and product announcements. Toyota selected NVIDIA's end-to-end platform to develop, train and validate self-driving vehicles. This broad partnership includes advancements in AI computing, infrastructure using NVIDIA GPUs, simulation using NVIDIA DRIVE Constellation platform and in-car AV computers based on the DRIVE AGX Xavier or Pegasus. We also announced the public availability of DRIVE Constellation, which enables millions of miles to be driven in virtual worlds across the broad range of scenarios with greater efficiency, cost effectiveness and safety than what's possible to achieve in the real world.

       "    \"Yeah. Thanks for taking the question. Colette, I was wondering if you could give a little bit more color or discussion around what exactly you've seen in the data center segment and whether or not or what you're looking for in terms of signs that we can kind of return to growth or maybe this pause is behind us? I guess what I'm really asking is kind of what's changed over the last, let's call it, three months relative to your prior commentary from a visibility perspective and just demand perspective within that segment.\",\n",
       "    'Sure. Thanks for the question as we start out here. I think when we had discussed our overall data center business three months ago, we did indicate that our visibility as we turned into the new calendar year was low. We had a challenge in terms of completing some of the deals at the end of that quarter. As we moved into Q1, I think we felt solid in terms of how we completed. We saw probably a combination of those moving forward continuing with their CapEx expenditures and building out in terms of what they need for the data centers. Some others are still in terms of the pause.',\n",
       "    \"So as we look in terms of with Q2, I think we see a continuation of what we have in terms of the visibility, not the best visibility going forward, but still rock-solid to what we think are benefits of what we provide in terms of a platform. Our overall priorities are aligned to what we see with the hyperscalers as well as the enterprises as they think about using AI in so many of their different workloads. But we'll just have to see as we go forward how this turns out. But right now, visibility probably just remains the same about as where we were when we started three months ago.\",\n",
       "    \"So at this time, we don't plan on giving a full-year overall guidance. I think our look in terms of gaming, all of the still drivers that we thought about earlier in the quarter and we talked about on our Investor Day and we have continued to talk about are still definitely in line. The drivers of our gaming business and Turing RTX for the future are still on track, but we're not providing guidance at this time for the full year.\",\n",
       "    'And your next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur of J. P. Morgan.',\n",
       "    'Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. On the last earnings call, you had mentioned China gaming demand has a headwind. At the Analyst Day in mid-March, I think Jensen had mentioned that the team was already starting to see better demand trends out of China maybe given the relaxed stance on gaming bans. Do you anticipate continued China gaming demand on a go-forward basis? And maybe talk about some of the dynamics driving that demand profile in the China geography?',\n",
       "    \"Sure. China looks fine. I think China has stabilized. The gaming market in China is really vibrant, and it continues to be vibrant. Tencent's releasing new games. I think you might have heard that Epic stores now are open in Asia, and games are available from the West. So there are all kinds of positive signs in China. There are some 300 million PC gamers in China, and people are expecting it to grow. We're expecting the total number of gamers to continue to grow from the 1-plus billion PC gamers around the world to something more than that. And so things look fine.\",\n",
       "    'Thanks for that. And then as a follow-up, a big part of the demand profile in the second half of the year for the gaming business is always the lineup of AAA-rated games. Obviously, you guys have a very close partnership with all of the game developers. How does the pipeline of new games look? Kind of they get launched October, November time frame, either total number of blockbuster games and also games supporting real-time ray tracing as well as some of your DLSS capabilities.',\n",
       "    \"Yes. Well, it's seasonal. Second half of the year, we expect to see some great games. We won't pre-announce anybody else's games for them, but this is a great PC cycle because it's the end of the console cycle, and PCs is just where the action is at these days with Battle Royale and eSports and so much social going on, the PC gaming ecosystem is just really vibrant. Our strategy with RTX was to take a lead and move the world to ray tracing. And at this point, I think it's fairly safe to say that the leadership position that we've taken has turned into a movement that has turned next-generation gaming ray tracing into a standard. Almost every single game platform will have to have ray tracing, and some of them already announced it.\",\n",
       "    'And your next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri with UBS.',\n",
       "    'Thank you. I guess the first question is for Colette. So what went into the decision to pull full year guidance versus just cutting it? Is it really to see around how long it could take for data center to come back? Thank you.',\n",
       "    \"Yes. I'll start off here and kind of go back to where our thoughts were in Q1 and why we provided full year guidance when we were in Q1. When we looked at Q1 and what we were guiding, we understood that it was certainly an extraordinary quarter, something that we didn't feel was a true representative of our business, and we wanted to get a better view of our trajectory of our business in terms of going forward.\",\n",
       "    'Okay. Thanks. And then just as a follow-up, can you give us some even qualitative, if not quantitative, sense of the $320 million incremental revenue for July, how that breaks out? Is the thinking sort of that data center is going to be flat to maybe up a little bit and pretty much the remainder of the growth comes from gaming? Thanks.',\n",
       "    'Yes. So when you think about our growth between Q1 and Q2, yes, we do expect in terms of our gaming to increase. We do expect our Nintendo Switch to start again in sizable amounts once we move into Q2, and we do at this time expect probably our data center business to grow.',\n",
       "    'And your next question comes from the line of Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs.',\n",
       "    \"Thanks for taking the question. Jensen, I had a follow-up on the data center business. And I was hoping you could provide some color in terms of what you're seeing not only from your hyperscale customers, which you've talked extensively on, but more on the enterprise and HP side of your business and specifically on the hyperscale side. You guys talk about this pause that you're seeing from your customer base. When you're having conversations with your customers, do they give you a reason as to why they're pausing? Is it too much inventory of GPUs and CPUs and so on and so forth? Or is it optimization giving them extra capacity? Is it caution on their own business going forward? Or is it a combination of all the above? Any color on that would be helpful, too. Thank you.\",\n",
       "    \"Of course, it's going to continue to evolve, but these models are gigantic to train. And in the case of Microsoft's network, it was trained on Volta GPUs, And these systems require large amounts of memory. The models are enormous. It takes an enormous amount of time to train these systems. And so we're seeing a breakthrough in conversational AI. And across the board, Internet companies would like to make their AI much more conversational, so that you can access through phones and smart speakers and be able to engage AI practically everywhere.\",\n",
       "    \"The work that we're doing in the industries makes a ton of sense. We're seeing AI adoption in just about all the industries from transportation to healthcare to retail to logistics, industrials, agriculture. And the reason for that is because they have a vast amount of data that they're collecting. And I heard a statistics just the other day from a talk that Satya gave that some 90% of today's data was created just two years ago and is being created by and gathered by these industrial systems all over the world.\",\n",
       "    \"And so we're seeing a ton of excitement around this area. Some people call it the intelligent edge, some people call it edge computing. And now with 5G networks coming, we're seeing a lot of interest around the edge computing servers that we're making. And so those are the activities that we're seeing.\",\n",
       "    'Yeah. When you look at our sequential gross margin increase, that will be influenced by our larger revenue and better mix, which you are correct, is our largest driver of our (ph) gross margin. However, we will be beginning the Nintendo Switch backup, and that does have lower gross margins than the company average, influencing therefore Q2 gross margin guidance that we had provided. As we look forward toward the rest of the year, we think mix and the higher revenue again will influence and likely rise our overall gross margins for the full year.',\n",

Our strategy for cloud gaming is to extend our PC position for GeForce gamers into the cloud, and our strategy for building out our network is partnerships with telcos around the world. And so we'll build out some of it. And on top of the service, we have our entire PC gaming stack. And when we host the service, we'll move to a subscription model. And with our telcos around the world, who would like to provision the service at their edge servers, and many of them would like to do so in conjunction with our 5G telco services to offer cloud gaming as a differentiator. And all of these different countries where PC exposure has been relatively low, we have an opportunity to extend our platform out to that billion PC gamers. And so that's our basic strategy.\",\n",
       "    \"And we also offer our edge server platform to all of the cloud service providers. Google has NVIDIA GPU graphics in the cloud, Amazon has NVIDIA GPU graphics in the cloud and Microsoft has NVIDIA GPU graphics in the cloud. And these GPUs will be fantastic also for cloud gaming and workstation graphics and also ray tracing. And so the platform is capable of running all of the things that NVIDIA runs, and we try to put it in every data center, in every cloud from every region that's possible.\",\n",

       "    'And your next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.',\n",
       "    'Thanks for taking my question. I actually had a clarification for Colette and a question for Jensen. Colette, are you now satisfied that the PC gaming business is operating at normal levels when you look at the Q2 guidance? Like are all the issues regarding inventory and other issues, are they over? Or do you think that the second half of the year is more the normalized run rate for your PC gaming business?',\n",
       "    \"And then Jensen, on the data center, NVIDIA has dominated the training market. Inference sounds a lot more fragmented and competitive. There's a lot of talk of software being written more at the framework level. How should we get the confidence that your lead in training will help you maintain a good lead in inference also? Thank you.\",\n",
       "    \"Thanks for the question. So let's start with your first part of the question regarding how we reached overall normalized gaming levels. When we look at our overall inventory in the channel, we believe that this is relatively behind us and moving forward that it will not be an issue. Going forward, we will probably reach normalized level for gaming somewhere between Q2 and Q3 similar to our discussion that we had back at Analyst Day, at the beginning of the quarter.\",\n",
       "    \"NVIDIA's strategy is accelerated computing. It is very different than an accelerator strategy. For example, if you were building a smart microphone, you need an accelerator for speech recognition, ASR. Our Company is focused on accelerated computing, and the reason for that is because the world's body of software is really gigantic, and the world's body of software continues to evolve. And AI is nowhere near done. We're probably at the first of couple of innings of AI of that. And so the amount of software and the size of the models are going to have to continue to evolve.\",\n",
       "    \"Our accelerated computing platform is designed to enable the computer industry to bring forward into the future all the software that exist today, whether it's TensorFlow or Caffe or PyTorch or it could be a classical machine learning algorithms like XGBoost, which is actually right now the most popular framework in machine learning overall. And there's so many different types of classical algorithms and not to mention all of the handwritten engineered algorithms by programmers. And those algorithms and those hand-engineered algorithms also would like to be mixed in with all of the deep learning or otherwise classical machine learning algorithms.\",\n",
       "    \"This whole body of software doesn't run on a single function accelerator. If you would like that body of software to run on something, it would have to be sufficiently general purpose. And so the balance that we made was we invented this thing called a Tensor Core that allows us to accelerate deep learning to the speed of light. Meanwhile, it has the flexibility of the CUDA so that we can bring forward everything in classical machine learning as people have started to see with RAPIDS and is being announced, being integrated into machine learning pipelines, in the cloud and elsewhere, and then also all of the high-performance computing applications or computer vision algorithms, image processing algorithms that don't have deep learning or machine learning alternatives. And so our Company is focused on accelerated computing.\",\n",
       "    \"And so the flexibility of our architecture and the incredible performance in deep learning is really a great balance and allows customers to deploy it easily. So our strategy is very different than an accelerator. I think the only accelerators that I really see successful at the moment are the ones that go into smart speakers. And surely, there are a whole bunch being talked about, but I think the real challenge is how to make it run real, real workloads. And we're going to keep cranking along in our current strategy and keep raising the bar as we have in the past.\",\n",

How do we sort of gauge the risk of, I guess, potential further deterioration in relationship sort of spilling over on the regulatory front around that deal? We've seen that obviously with some of the other large deals in the space. What are your thoughts on that?\",\n",

So if you think about the trends you're seeing in enterprise virtualization, in HPC and all the work you're doing around RAPIDS, rendering, et cetera, can you kind of talk through the visibility you have today for that part of your business? I think that's roughly 50% of the mix. So is that a piece that you feel confident you can grow in 2019? And any color around that would be appreciated.\",\n",
       "    \"T4 servers for enterprise were announced, I guess, about halfway through the quarter. And the OEMs are super excited about that because the number of companies in the world who want to do data analytics, predictive data analytics is quite large, and the size of the data is growing so significantly. And with Moore's Law ending, it's really hard to power through terabytes of data at a time. And so we've been working on building the software stack from the new memory architectures and storage architectures all the way to the computational middleware, and it's called RAPIDS. And I appreciate you saying that, and that's being put together in the activity in GitHub is just fantastic. And so you could see all kinds of companies jumping in to make contributions, because they would like to be able to take that open-source software and run it in their own data center on our GPUs. And so I expect the enterprise side of our business, both for enterprise big data analytics or for edge computing, to be a really good growth driver for us this year.\",\n",
       "    \"As a follow-up, real quickly on auto. It's a business that you talked about, more R&D focused, but clearly I think has surprised positively. What's the visibility like there? And how should we think about growth trajectory into the second half of the year?\",\n",
       "    \"We just announced this last quarter, a new infrastructure called Constellation that lets you essentially drive thousands and thousands of test cars in your data center, and they're all going through pseudo-directed random or directed scenarios that allows you to either test untestable scenarios or regress against previous scenarios, and we call that Constellation. And then lastly, after working on a car for several years, we would install the computer inside the car, and we call that DRIVE.\",\n",
       "    \"And so these are the four components of opportunities that we have in the automotive industry. We're doing great in China. There's a whole bunch of electric vehicles being created. The robotaxis' developments around the world largely use NVIDIA's technology. We recently announced the partnership with Toyota. There's a whole bunch of stuff that we're working on, and I'm anxious to announce them to you.\",\n",
       "    \"But this is an area that is the tip of the iceberg of a larger space we call robotics and computing at the edge. But if you think about the basic computational pipeline of a self-driving car, it's no different essentially than a smart retail or the future of computational medical instruments, agriculture, industrial inspection, delivery drones, all basically use essentially the same technique. And so this is the foundational work that we're going to do for a larger space that people call the intelligent edge or computing at the edge.\",\n",

       "    \"Yes. Thank you. Good afternoon. First question is on notebooks and just to clarify what's been different from your expectations this year. Is it simply that the OEMs didn't launch the new models you had expected given the shortage? Or is it more just about unit volume? And then just following up on that, what's your level of confidence in that coming back to be a driver as you go into the second half of the year?\",\n",
       "    \"That's very helpful. Thank you. As a follow-up, I just want to follow up on some of the previous questions on the automotive market. And we've been talking about it for a while. Obviously, the design cycles are very long, so you do have some visibility, and I guess the question is when can we expect an acceleration of auto revenue. Is next year the year? And then what would be the driver of that in terms of dollar contribution? I presume some of the Level 2+ things you've been talking about would probably mean most likely they're given the amount of volume there. If you can confirm that and just give some color on expectations for drivers?\",\n",
       "    \"Yes. Level 2+, call it 2020, late 2021 like or 2022-ish. So that's Level 2+. I would say 2019, very, very early for robotaxis; next year, substantially more volume for robotaxis; 2021, bigger volumes for robotaxis. The ASP differences, the amount of computation you put into a robotaxi because of sensor resolutions, sensor diversity and redundancy, the computational redundancy and the richness of the algorithm, all of it put together, it's probably an order of magnitude plus in computation. And so the economics would reflect that. And so that robotaxi is kind of like next year, the year after, ramp. And then think of Level 2+ as 2021, 2022.\",\n",
       "    \"Overall, remember that our economics come from four different parts. And so there's the NRE components of it, there's the AI development infrastructure, computing infrastructure part of it, the simulation part of it called Constellation and then the economics of the car. And so we just announced Constellation. The enthusiasm around that is really great. Nobody should ever ship anything they don't simulate. And my expectation is that billions of miles will get simulated inside a simulator long before they'll ship it. And so that's a great opportunity for Constellation.\",\n",

I understand there's a lack of visibility in certain parts of the business on revenue, but maybe you could talk about OpEx trends through the rest of the year, where you might have a little more visibility? Thank you.\",\n",
       "    \"And as Colette said earlier, somewhere between Q2 and Q3, we'll get back to normal levels for gaming. And so we're off to a great start in Turing, and I'm super excited about that. And in the second half of the year, we would have fully ramped up from top to bottom our Turing architecture, spanning everything from 179 to as high performance as you like. And we have the best price, best performance and best GPU at every single price point. And so I think we're in a pretty good shape.\",\n",
       "    \"In terms of process nodes, we tend to design our own process with TSMC. If you look at our process and you measure its energy efficiency, it's off the charts. And in fact, if you take our Turing and you compare it against a 7-nanometer GPU on energy efficiency, it's incomparable. In fact, the world's 7-nanometer GPU already exists. And it's easy to go and pull that and compare the performance and energy efficiency against one of our Turing GPUs. And so the real focus for our engineering team is to engineer a process that makes sense for us and to create an architecture that is energy efficient. And the combination of those two things allows us to sustain our leadership position. Otherwise, buying off the shelf process is something that we can surely do, but we want to do much more than that.\",\n",

And to discuss your question regarding OpEx trajectory for the rest of the year, we're still on track to our thoughts on leaving the fiscal year with a year-over-year growth and overall OpEx on a non-GAAP basis in the high single digits. We'll see probably an increase sequentially quarter-to-quarter along there, but our year-over-year growth will start to decline as we will not be growing at the speed that we did in this last year.

       "    'Thanks, Simona. As you know, we lowered our fourth-quarter guidance on January 28, and our results are in line with our preannouncement. Q4 revenue was $2.21 billion, down 24% from a year earlier, driven primarily by a 45% year-on-year decline in gaming. Full-year revenue was $11.72 billion, up 21% from our previous year.',\n",
       "    'Starting with our gaming business, revenue of $954 million was down 45% year on year and down 46% sequentially, weaker than our expectations heading into the quarter. Full-year revenue was up 13% to $6.25 billion. Three factors contributed to the Q4 gaming revenue decline. First, post-crypto inventory of GPUs in the channel caused us to reduce shipments in order to allow access channel inventory to sell through.',\n",
       "    'We expect channel inventories to normalize in Q1, in line with one to two-quarter timeline we had outlined on our previous earnings call. Second, deteriorating macroeconomic conditions, particularly in China, impacted consumer demand for our GPUs. And third, sales of certain high-end GPUs using our new Turing architecture, including the GeForce RTX 2080 and 2070, were lower than we expected for the launch of a new architecture. These products deliver a revolutionary leap in performance and innovation with real-time ray tracing and A.I., but some customers may have delayed their purchase while waiting for lower price points or further demonstration of the RTX technology in actual games.',\n",
       "    'The significant volatility in our gaming business over the last few quarters has been challenging to model. Crypto mining demand and its after effects have distorted the quarter-to-quarter trends in the gaming business and obscured its underlying trend line. Let me try to give you some visibility into what we believe the normalized business looks like. As you know, our gaming business consists of desktop gaming, notebook gaming and gaming console products.',\n",
       "    \"To get a sense of the underlying run rate in our gaming business last year, it is helpful to look at desktop gaming revenue across a period that doesn't include crypto demand. Let's look at the four quarters starting from Q2 of last year to the current quarter, or Q1 of this year. In Q2 and Q3 of last year, with the benefit of hindsight, we shipped a higher amount of desktop gaming products relative to where end demand turned out to be. To allow the channel to work down that excess channel inventory, we shipped a lower amount relative to end demand in Q4, and we'll do so again in Q1.\",\n",
       "    'Therefore, exiting Q1, we expect channel inventories to be at normal levels. On average, our desktop gaming revenue across these four quarters is about $900 million. We believe this represents the normalized level of desktop gaming for this period. Notebook gaming and gaming consoles have averaged close to $500 million per quarter over these same four quarters.',\n",
       "    'Thus, in total, we believe our normalized quarterly gaming business revenue run rate is approximately $1.4 billion. As we look past Q1, we expect the channel inventory correction to be behind us and our business to have bottomed. On a full-year basis, we expect our gaming business to be down slightly, given the tough first-half compares with growth in Turing and notebook gaming. At CES last month, we launched into the recovery of our gaming business.',\n",

And so I think people are starting to understand now the benefits of the RTX technology, and we just needed some time to demonstrate it.

It attracts a lot more players because it's social and you want to play with your friends, and it's much stickier because it happens to be social, it happens to be a game where you have to play with a whole bunch of other people. So I think that gaming is vibrant as ever before.\",\n",

If you compare also the rate at which our gaming notebook is growing, I think that's pretty exciting. I think last year, we had mentioned it before, that our gaming notebook business grew 50% year over year. And just at CES, the number of new notebook designs that came out with Turing, because of an invention that we created called Max-Q; and because of the energy efficiency of the Turing architecture, you can now make notebooks that are really wonderful and also high performing at the same time.\",\n",

       "    \"Meanwhile the CSPs, they're possible end, the amount of computation they do is increasing. More and more of them are using deep learning, and we have Inference opportunity with the work that we did with T4 and TensorRT. And so we've got a lot of exciting opportunities to go.\",\n",

       "    \"Hi, thanks for taking my question. A question for Colette. I'm trying to figure out how your position with cloud data centers evolved last year in financial-year 2019. So if I look at Cloud CAPEX, they were over that 70%.\",\n",
       "    'If I look at the CPU going into the cloud, according to Intel, was up about 60%. So I was wondering how much you guys have been increasing revenues within your cloud business. Did you grow faster than CPUs? Did you grow faster than overall CAPEX? And then I have a follow up on 2020.',\n",
       "    'Sure, let me start on that piece. As we talked about earlier on the call, our hyperscales and our hyperscales, many of them are also cloud providers. Did start to slow down in terms of their purchasing in the latter half of the year. But the overall growth rate, as you can see from our data center business, grew more than 50% for the full year.',\n",
       "    'Now even with that strong growth, we are still a very small percentage of overall CAPEX that we see in the cloud providers or the overall hyperscale. We are likely one of their top priorities of areas of where they need to grow in terms of in their data center as they focus on A.I., as they focus on the cloud instances [Inaudible] important of that compute and necessary. But we are still a very, very small percentage of it. So a slowdown in the second half of the year, full-year growth, phenomenal growth of 50%.',\n",
       "    'And we track with our properties.',\n",
       "    'Thanks, Colette. But this 50% growth, is that from you overall data center business? Is that what like your specifically your cloud hyperscale business grew as well? Or did that grow even faster than that?',\n",
       "    'Yes, depending on the quarter, we will have a mix of what is hyperscale growth or what is cloud. And again, in the core, in the fourth quarter, that was not a growth opportunity for us. But earlier in the year, definitely it was.',\n",
       "    \"And when we listen to other providers around you, they all seem to be, I mean they all demonstrate a bit of coincidence that in the second half, spending should resume. Is that just because they are being more optimistic than you? Do they see something you don't see? What do you hear from your clients about the second half?\",\n",
       "    \"We're enthusiastic about the second half. We're enthusiastic about our position, and we're enthusiastic about the solution we offer. And, Pierre, as you know, we've also expanded our application and our market reach. We guided, I think probably the biggest takeaway is we guided flight to slightly down for the whole year, for the whole number.\",\n",
       "    'We do have four growth drivers, and maybe the best way to think about it is we should just wait and see how it goes. I think considering where we are, I feel pretty good about our guidance. But I feel even better about our strategic position. And so I look forward to working through the year with you guys.',\n",

       "    \"Good afternoon, thanks for taking my question. On the China gaming weakness, is it the slower economic environment? Or is it sort of government policy related? Because we know that the China government has had a freeze on new gaming approvals, although they've recently started to approve new games. This ban is in place I think since the first half of last year. So given what you know of the business, how much of the China weakness is coming from the China gaming ban versus just overall floor economic environment?\",\n",
       "    \"I don't know that we could tear that apart, tease that apart, Harlan. We just know that China, the consumer market is relatively slow toward the end of the year. But the China economy is, in the funnel analysis, a growth economy. And so we're looking forward to it recovering.\",\n",

Data center, professional visualization, and automotive all hit record levels. However, gaming was short of expectations as post crypto channel inventory took longer than expected to sell through. Gaming card prices, which were elevated following the sharp crypto falloff, took longer than expected to normalize.',\n",
       "    'Our Q4 outlook for gaming reflects very little shipment in the midrange Pascal segment to allow channel inventory to normalize. In Q4, we also expect minimal sales of Tegra chips for game consoles due to the normal seasonal build cycle. While the channel inventory situation presents a near-term headwind, it does not change our long-term fundamentals. Our competitive position is as strong as ever, and we have expanded our addressable market with Turing and our recent software announcement. We remain excited about the growth opportunities in ray-traced gaming, rendering, high-performance computing, AI, and self-driving cars.',\n",

This reflects our continued shift toward higher-value platforms but also included a $57 million charge for prior architecture components and chips following the sharp falloff of crypto mining demand. Both GAAP and non-GAAP net income exceeded $1 million for the fourth consecutive quarter. From a reporting segment perspective, GPU revenue grew 25% from a year ago to $2.77 billion. Tegra processor revenue was down 3% to $407 million.',\n",
       "    \"Let's continue with our gaming business. Revenue of $1.76 billion was up 13% year-on-year and down 2% sequentially. Year-on-year growth was driven by initial sales of our new Turing-based GPUs as well as strong notebook sales, which more than offset gaming console declines. In mid-September, we began shipping GeForce RTX series, the first gaming GPUs based on our Turing architecture. Turing RTX technology delivers up to 2x the performance of its predecessor, Pascal, and 6x more for ray-traced graphics. These are the biggest generational gems we have ever delivered in gaming GPUs.\",\n",
       "    'The first two GeForce RTX gaming cards to hit the shelves were the 2080 Ti and the 2080, delivering 4K HDR gaming and 60 frames per second on even the most advanced AAA titles, a major milestone for gamers. This is quickly becoming the new performance baseline as 4K displays are now reaching affordable price points. These two high-end cards were quickly followed by the rollout of the GeForce 27D. NVIDIA RTX technology brings games to life like never before. The highly anticipated Battlefield V launched this week with the first release of RTX ray-tracing, enabling lifelike reflections on GeForce RTX GPUs. With a pipeline of upcoming games supporting NVIDIA RTX features, RTX is well on its way to establishing itself as a game-changing architecture.',\n",
       "    'Although the cryptocurrency wave has ended, the channel has taken longer than expected to normalize. Pascal high-end cards have largely sold through ahead of RTX. However, on midrange Pascal gaming cards, both channel prices and inventory levels remained higher than expected. Pascal is well positioned as the GPU of choice in the midrange for the holidays, and we expect to work down channel inventories over the next quarter or two.',\n",
       "    'Moving to data center, we had another strong quarter with revenue of $792 million, up 58% year-on-year and up 4% sequentially. Demand remains strong for both the architecture products, including Tesla V100 and VGX systems, and our inference business continued to grow, benefiting from the launch of the Turing T4 Cloud GPU during the quarter. Just 2 months after its launch, the T4 has received the fastest adoption of any server GPU. It is integrated into 57 server designs and it is already on the Google Cloud Platform, its first cloud availability. The T4 delivers world record performance for deep learning inference and accelerates diverse cloud workloads, including high-performance computing, deep learning training and inference, machine learning, data analytics and graphics.',\n",
       "    'We also announced an updated TensorRT software stack and NVIDIA TensorRT Hyperscale Platform. This new software includes two critically important capabilities that can drive deployment of the NVIDIA inference platform at scale in hyperscale data centers. First, it enables multiple models and multiple frameworks to run on the same GPU at the same time. This can drive higher data center utilization, directly translating to significant savings. Second, it integrates with Kubernetes, the leading orchestration layer for hyperscale data centers.',\n",
       "    'Completing our inference platform, the new T4 GPU delivers 12x the peak inference performance of its P4 predecessor. All told, our inference platform delivers 40x faster performance in CPUs. And with the tensor RT software stack, it is ideally suited for hyper-scale data centers. With this launch, NVIDIA is poised to take the data center inference market targeting every server node in the hyper-scale data centers. Another important launch for the quarter was the NVIDIA RTX server reference architecture, which incorporates up to eight Turing-based RT 8,000.',\n",
       "    'With this product, Turing opens a new market to GPUs, photo-real rendering or the creation of computer-generated images that look real. Rendering is instrumental to large industries, such as media and entertainment, retail, product designs, manufacturing, and architecture. Yet prior to Turing and its retracing capabilities, GPUs were not able to address this workload, so most rendering up to this point has been done on CPUs. And RTX accelerated render form, compared with an equivalent performance CPU render form, is one-fourth the cost, one-tenth the space, and one-eleventh the power.',\n",
       "    \"NVIDIA's RTX platform has garnered major industry support including from key developers such as Adobe, Ansys, Autodesk, Devo, and many others. Lastly, NVIDIA announced a GPU acceleration platform for data science and machine learning called Rapids, which enables companies to analyze massive amounts of data and make accurate business predictions at unprecedented speed. Up until now, data analytics and machine learning has been the largest [webcast cuts out].\",\n",

That has never been accelerated before, and we worked with the open source community over the course of the last several years to pull together an entire stack that starts from a patchy arrow, the desk parallel distributed computing engine, and then all of our CUDA and all of our algorithms that run on top of that, we now have an accelerated machine learning platform. That's a brand new platform, and the excitement around that is really quite incredible.\",\n",
       "    \"The second thing is the Turing architecture allows us to do film rendering at a much more affordable way than Moore's law would've allowed. And then the third, which we just announced recently, is our first Turing based T4 cloud GPU. And along with all of the software stack that we've put on top of it, Kubernetes, the docker, the TRT inference engine, our second-generation tensor core, AI accelerator. All of that together has created a lot of excitement in data centers. I'm expecting our data center business to continue to do quite well.\",\n",
       "    'Great, thanks for that. And then just on the high-end Turing products that the team started rolling out in October. Early demand actually seems to be quite strong, and I think part of it is just the line-up of triple-A rated gains, e-sports continues strong as well. Obviously, a big motivator for your enthusiast class gamers. I know the team is near-term kind of working down mid-range Pascal cards, but do you anticipate your Turing based RTX product families to drive sequential growth into January quarter? Just what appears to be pretty strong demand-pull for these products?',\n",
       "    \"Not much happened toward the end of the quarter and it's the biggest generational leap we've ever had. It introduced real-time retracing, it's the first gaming GPU to include artificial intelligence. At every single price point it serves, it is substantially higher performance than the last, and is the highest performing GPU in the world. And all the great content are coming. Yesterday I think it was the Battlefield 5 was released with real-time retracing, the world's first application to support real-time retracing. So we expect to do really well. As we go on, surely we'll bring Turing deeper into the mainstream. We don't have anything to announce today but as usual, we want to bring a brand new architecture to as many gamers as possible.\",\n",

       "    'Your next question is from Vivek Arya with Merrill Lynch.',\n",
       "    \"Thanks for taking my question. I'm curious, Jensen, what needs to happen to work down this midrange Pascal inventory? Is it pricing, is it something else? Because the thinking was that this could be cleared within the October quarter but it hasn't. Do you think people who are waiting for Turing to come out so maybe that created some pause? And then as part of part B of that question, maybe Colette, how should we think about seasonality in the April quarter given that you mention it could take one or two quarters to work down this inventory? Thank you.\",\n",
       "    \"I guess when pricing it is volatile in the channel, it probably freezes some people waiting for prices to stabilize. That took longer than we expected, frankly. But now that it's at the right levels our expectation is that the market will return to normal. 1060 is the number one selling graphics card in the world. And we decided not to sell anymore into the channel for the upcoming quarter to give the channel an opportunity to sell through the inventory it has. So we'll keep our eyes on it but our expectation is that inventory levels will come back to the normal by the end of the quarter.\",\n",
       "    \"Okay, Vivek, to answer your question also regarding Q1 in terms of what we're gonna see in terms of the expectation. As the channel inventory normalizes at the end of Q4, we do believe going into Q1 we will be probably up from where we end in terms of Q4. So we won't follow that normal seasonality between Q1 and Q4. We do expect to be up as we go into Q1.\",\n",
       "    'You have a question from C.J. Muse with Evercore.',\n",
       "    \"Hi, thanks for taking the question. I guess a follow-up question on the channel inventory side. It looks like it's roughly $600 million kind of a draw-down here. I'm just curious; does that sound right number one? Number two, does that fit with what you are hearing from your channel partners in terms of what's excess? And then as part of that, are you drawing down inventory in the current quarter ahead of Turing architecture launch into the mainstream?\",\n",
       "    \"The last question I'm not sure I understand. I think the answer to your first question is yes. You framed it nicely and the answer is yes. The last question was what again?\",\n",

       "    \"We haven't announced our future Turing product but it would be expected for us to create a Turing GPU that serves the mainstream parts of the marketplace. And so we're not announcing anything but it would be conventional of us to do that.\",\n",
       "    'The question was whether you were drawing down inventory perhaps below normalized levels in the current quarter?',\n",
       "    \"No, we're really not shipping into the midrange segment of Pascal so that we give the channel an opportunity to sell through the product at house. And we would like to see channel inventory get normalized by the end of Q4. And then get back to doing our work.\",\n",

       "    'Thanks for taking my questions. My first one is for Colette. I wanted to be a little more explicit. If I think about your business split into a sort of gaming and non-gaming, are you looking for the non-gaming pieces in aggregate to grow sequentially into Q4?',\n",
       "    'Yes. I think the answer to that is yes. In aggregate, yes, we do believe the rest of the business will grow sequentially.',\n",
       "    \"I guess that fits with the one-third you were talking about because that implies the gaming down 30% plus so that is what your kind of magnitude that you're thinking about at this point?\",\n",
       "    'That is correct.',\n",
       "    \"Got it. Thank you. For my second question, for the last several quarters the idea of the channel could be getting full is not necessarily a new worry. And yet the last several quarters you've been saying on this call that you guys felt like you had a really good handle on the channel and yet it seems like maybe that wasn't exactly the case.\",\n",
       "    \"Can you give us a feeling for what changed and when you saw it in the quarter? Was this something that happened late in the quarter that you realized it or did you go into the quarter knowing the inventories needed to be corrected? Like, what happened? Because this tone is a little different from what we've heard over the last few earnings calls from you.\",\n",
       "    \"We were surprised, obviously. We're surprised by it as anybody else. The crypto hangover lasted longer than we expected. Prices started to drift down and we expected to come down much more quickly than it did. When it went down, we expected demand to come up much more quickly than it did. And so I think the channel wanted to protect its price. People were uncertain about crypto.\",\n",
       "    \"And demand was uncertain about when the price would be stabilized. And so all of that uncertainty I think froze the market a little longer than we expected. Pricing is now down to below pre-launch normal levels and so I'm hopeful that we're gonna see demand come back and the sell-through will happen through the holidays. And we're seeing that. We didn't expect it either and we didn't realize the magnitude of it until toward the end of the quarter. What was the other question? Was there another question? I think that was it.\",\n",
       "    'Your next question is from Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley.',\n",
       "    \"And so I think that the demand is great. I'm expecting it to be just a fantastic new generation. In terms of the content, you sell the first one. Final Fantasy is also out and we have a pipeline of about 30 of them. We're working hard on that. And so when these games get released, RTX will be enabled. I will say one last thing, which is content aside, RTX is high performing at the same price point than any graphics card on the planet. So at every single price point, it is the highest performing graphics card. It's unambiguously the highest performance GPU in the world, and of course, all of these great new features will be coming.\",\n",
       "    'Your next question is from Pierre Ferragu with New Street Research.',\n",
       "    \"Hey, thank you for taking my questions. I'm still trying to get my head around the magnitude of this China inventory drawdown because if you don't change like the midrange or full quarter that means your inventory is more than a quarter, 12 weeks of sales. And so my first question would be, am I right thinking that? Are you bringing those full quarter sale in inventories? And then my second question is, while you are going down these inventories, are we expected to see maturing high-end car for 2018 and the 20 ATI ramping in Q4? Excluding inventory, the rights of the business, the rest of the distributing that's been gaining would be more like flattish sequentially?\",\n",
       "    \"I'm trying to figure out what the first part of the question was.\",\n",
       "    'I think the channel has more than 12 weeks of inventory between us and the other brand. One of the things that is hard to estimate is how much inventory the other brands have. Our quarter is one month later and so whatever action we take, whatever we see in the channel, is one month after their end of the quarter.',\n",
       "    'Your next question is from Mark Lipacis with Jefferies.',\n",
       "    \"Thanks for taking my question. I was hoping you could contrast this product cycle transition to Turing to the product transition you had to Pascal. Is the main difference the crypto hangover? Is there something else impacting the transition do you think? You've described Turing as the greatest generational leap, and I'm wondering if that larger delta has an impact onto the transition as well? Thanks.\",\n",
       "    \"Turing is the highest performance GPU at every single price point. It played no role in this transition. It's all about crypto hangover. This is the new experience as we made this transition. If you look at Turing, it had a great launch. We ramped it at the end of the quarter as we expected, it was backend loaded as we expected, and the ramp was great. Everybody did a great job. The performance is fantastic. And the excitement is great. And so I think Turing's ramp was a big success. Underneath Turing was choppy as we're talking about. We really didn't see that until toward the end of the quarter. And as we looked out into this quarter, we came to the conclusion that the best thing to do was just not to ship anymore products into this segment of the marketplace.\",\n",
       "    'You have a question from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo.',\n",
       "    \"Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe I can ask the question a little bit differently on the gaming business. If I look back over the past several quarters. Let's say you've been running at roughly a 1.6-1.8 billion-revenue level since the October 17 quarter. Prior to that, you were at 1.1-1.2 billion. We look like we're now going back to that level. The question is; do we build off of that level, do we bring back half of the inventory burn?\",\n",
       "    \"How do you think about the return of your growth in that gaming piece of the business as we start to look into fiscal 2020? And a quick second question. Over the past three years, you've had really strong seasonal sequential growth in the data center business in Q4, about 20% sequentially. I'm just curious, how is your guide factoring in the sequential growth in that piece of the business into this current quarter?\",\n",
       "    \"Let me take the second one first. Our data center business is doing great. The fundamental dynamics of accelerated computing is spot on. And with Moore's law coming to an end, it's the path forward. Take a look at a number of systems in the top 500, 127 systems this year. a growth of nearly 50% year-over-year with the number one system in the United States, in the world, in Europe and Japan. We're 22 out of the top 25 most energy-efficient computers in the world. In this quarter, we announced three new initiatives that's going to expand us into a broader part of the high-performance computing market with machine learning, which as we know is the largest part of artificial intelligence today, which has not been accelerated and now it is.\",\n",
       "    \"The second is the ability to do rendering for film and photorealistic rendering for the first time. And then the third is a brand new cloud GPU we call T4 that the enthusiasm around it is just incredible. And from the time that we went to production to the time that Google put it in their cloud was literally 30 days. It's just an incredible speed of adoption. And so I expect T4 to do quite well. So I think our data center business dynamics are really quite great. In terms of forecast, we'll just see how it turns out. But I think the fundamental dynamics are great. Back to your question about gaming.\",\n",
       "    \"And so the gaming market seems quite robust. RTX is going to unquestionably redefine gaming computer graphics. And so I think the dynamics are good. We have to work through the channel inventories. This quarter, of course, we had the simultaneous decision of not shipping any more midrange products into the channel as well as seasonal console build plans. They tend to build out a quarter before the holiday season. So you have these two simultaneous effects. But there's nothing about the gaming marketplace or the gaming business that we see that is fundamentally different.\",\n",
       "    'To kind of add to that, think about our gaming business in several pieces that we talked about in terms of the tremendous strength that is also continuing in terms of our success in terms of Turing, our notebooks for gaming are growing extremely strong, and our overall console business is also extremely healthy as well. So to think about all of the different components, we just have a piece of channel inventory at the midrange but overall as you can see, gaming is also growing quite well.',\n",
       "    'Your next question is from Chris Caso with Raymond James.',\n",
       "    \"Yes, thanks, good evening. Thanks for taking the question. A question with regard to inferencing and what we can expect from that for both Q4 and going forward. Perhaps, I don't know if it's a valid comparison to compare what we might expect from inferencing after the new Quadro launches to what happened in training after the Volta launches. Is there any comparison there in terms of magnitude or how the ramp goes?\",\n",
       "    \"The ramp of T4 is completely related to customers porting their model on top of our platform. And the inference model is really complicated. This is one of the things that I've talked about in the past. That on the one hand, people think that inference appears to be simple because there's so many ASICs built being talked about. the vast majority of the complexity of inference is actually in the optimizing compiler on top. The TensorRT fifth generation optimizing compiler that we announced just recently took three or four years to build.\",\n",
       "    \"And then on top of that, in order to get it to scale as quickly as what people saw in Google's cloud requires us to build something called a TRT server, an inference server that allows multiple models to run on top of Kubernetes in the cloud. That piece of software is also super complicated to write. And so the pieces of technology that we're putting together have come together. And now we're engaged with companies around the world to port their most heavy workload applications on top or models on top of T4. So we're working hard on that and when that happens it comes down to their decision of how many they would like to buy and that tells us about our adoption rate. I think from a high-level perspective, if we step back for a second, the high-level way to look at it is this.\",\n",
       "    \"We know for a fact that Moore's law has come to an end. And at the same time, we also know that more and more data centers are deploying deep learning models and machine learning models into their data center. And it's computationally really intensive. At this time, and as we look out into the horizon, the T4 cloud GPU is just unquestionably the most effective. It can run models whether it's an image model or a recommendation model or a speech synthesis model. It is the highest throughput processor in the world at 70 watts, which fits into a hyper-scale data center OCP server. It is also the lowest latency of any processor at inferencing in the world at less than one millisecond.\",\n",
       "    'And so between the architecture, all of the software technology and all of the software capabilities we put in place and the fact that the conditions would suggest that internet companies need an accelerated path forward, I think T4 is really well positioned. And I look forward to coming back and telling you guys about success.',\n",
       "    'You have a question from Will Stein with SunTrust.',\n",
       "    \"Good evening. Thank you for taking my questions. First, Jensen, I appreciate all the details on the T4 for inference in the data center. Could you likewise highlight the current traction you're seeing and the long-term growth expectations for the Jetson product that's designed for really I think a different market, it's inference at the edge, right?\",\n",
       "    \"Jetson is designed for edge AI. One version of Jetson, which is an AV functional save, high performance with loads of complicated software. One version of that you could say is self-driving cars. This quarter we announced winning our first mass-market level two. We've been really successful in robot taxis and level fours and trucks and shuttles and high-end systems where the number of processors, the number of sensors, the combination of lidars and surround cameras require a lot of computation. We've never been successful until now. We're taking the drive platform all the way down to level two mass-market cars. Volvo is our first announcement, our first win in high-volume early 2020s production ramp.\",\n",
       "    \"I'm expecting many more. I think we've positioned and created a solution that is both highly useful and easy to use as well as could deliver level two capability in a single chip for the very first time. And, Xavier is in production. It is the only single-chip autonomous processor in production today. Now, you take that same platform and you could apply to all kinds of other edge AI devices. It could be manufacturing picking robots, it could be autonomous retail, basically AI retail, autonomous warehouses. Or medical instruments, medical imaging instruments that in the device itself recognizes and identifies anomalies. All of these types of applications are leaning toward AI and that's the reason why we built Jetson.\",\n",
       "    'Your next question is from Craig Ellis with B. Riley.',\n",
       "    \"Thanks for taking the question. I'll ask a clarification and then a question. The clarification is just on the inventory issue and thanks for all the color but one, are Pascal 1070s and 1080s in TI flavors still selling and if so, could they present any kind of inventory risk either later this year or in early fiscal '20? The question really, Jensen, is trying to get a better understanding of how you see the intermediate term growth rate of the data center business. You had a spectacular high performance compute top 500-accelerator penetration performance up 50+%. That about matches the growth in the data center business.\",\n",
       "    \"Those may be somewhat coincidental but can you just talk about where you see penetration across key end markets like HPC, like cloud and hyper-scale, and like enterprise. Which offers you the best growth from here? And where do you feel like your penetration may be more mature? I'm just trying to get a sense if there's an acceleration coming off of the 50% year-on-year growth that we're seeing now or if consistent with the recent trend we might be moderating potentially down into the 40% or 30% range as we go into the next calendar year? Thank you so much.\",\n",
       "    'Our high-end Pascal GPUs are largely sold. And we did a fairly good job making sure that with that transition before we ramped up the high-end Turing products. Our data center business; I would say the Q3 inventory set back aside, I actually have to say it was one of the best quarters we ever experienced. The reason for that is because of our data center position, our accelerated computing position as a company, which is the foundation of this company. The accelerated computing focus of our company expanded in really several ways. For the first part of our journey into a celebrated computing was really following scientific computing, simulating first principle laws of physics for scientific computing and high-performance computing codes.',\n",
       "    \"We know for a fact that Moore's law has come to an end and those servers are gonna have to be accelerated going forward. And so I think that T4 is just ideal for that. It was designed from the ground up to deliver computing in a very compressed and very condensed power sensitive environment, which these hyper-scale data centers tend to be. And the software stack from Kubernetes to containers to TRT compiler to the TRT inference server and our NGC cloud with all of the stacks fully accelerated and then containerized in the cloud certifying all of the major cloud providers around the world for our containers. That process took us several years and it's put us in a really great place. So T4 is really fantastic. And so that's the second segment of high-performance computing, is deep learning.\",\n",
       "    'The third and potentially the largest currently is machine learning. This is where Hadoop goes. This is where Spark goes, this is where Scikit-learn, Python, Pandas. All of the data scientists around the world in retail and transportation and logistics and healthcare and financial services that are using algorithms like Random Forest and XGBoost and k-nearest and k-means and PCA and all of these different buzzwords have never had the opportunity to have accelerated computing until now. And this took a couple two or three years for us to pull together. Rapids has been open sourced. You can go into the NGC cloud, download it, IBM is gonna integrate it into their machine learning platform. SASS, SAP, Oracle, the cloud providers are all integrating the Rapids open source SDK into their machine learning platform. And so this is a new segment for us.',\n",
       "    'The answer about our growth rate is I believe that our accelerated computing, our data center opportunity, has significantly expanded during the quarter. Between the T4 hyper-scale cloud GPU and Rapids machine learning platform, it has shortened our RTX server film rendering. We surely have expanded our data center opportunity. And so I fully expect us to continue to do well in accelerated computing for data centers.',\n",
       "    'Unfortunately, we have run out of time. I will now turn the call back over to Jensen for any closing remarks.',\n",
       "    \"Thanks, everyone. To sum up: the crypto hangover has left the industry with excess China inventory. It will take one or two quarters to work through it. This is an unexpected near-term setback and it doesn't change the fundamental dynamics of our company. The end of Moore's law has cleared a way for NVIDIA accelerated computing as a great path forward. Turing opens up three exciting markets for us with retracing games, film rendering, and hyper-scale inference. And with our first win in mainstream level two self-driving cars with Volvo, our drive AV platform is gearing up for the mass market. And our competitive position has never been stronger.

       "    'Thanks, Simona. We had an excellent quarter with growth across all our performs, led by gaming and data center. Q1 revenue reached a record $3.21 billion, up 66% year-on-year, up 10% sequentially, and above our outlook of $2.9 billion. Once again, all measures of profitability set records. With GAAP gross margins at 64.5%, operating margin at 40.4%, and net income at $1.24 billion. From a reporting segment perspective, Q1 GPU revenue grew 77% from last year to $2.77 billion. Tegra Processor revenue rose 33% to $442 million.',\n",
       "    \"Let's start with our gaming business. Revenue was $1.72 billion, up 68% year-on-year, and down 1% sequentially. Demand was strong and broad-based across regions and products. The gaming market remains robust and the popular battle royale genre is attracting a new wave of gamers to the GeForce platform. We also continue to see demand from upgrades, with about 35% of our installed base currently on our Pascal architecture. The launch of popular titles like Far Cry 5, and Final Fantasy XV continue to drive excitement in the quarter.\",\n",
       "    \"We expect RTX, as well as other new technologies like 4K and virtual reality, to continue driving gamers' requirements for higher GPU performance. While supply was tight earlier in the quarter, the situation is now easing. As a result, we are pleased to see that channel prices for our GPUs are beginning to normalize, allowing gamers who had been priced out of the market last quarter to get their hands on a new GeForce GTX at a reasonable price.\",\n",
       "    \"Cryptocurrency demand was, again, stronger than expected, but we were able to fulfill most of it with crypto-specific GPUs, which are included in our OEM business at $289 million. As a result, we could protect the vast majority of our limited gaming GPU supply for use by gamers. Looking into Q2, we expect crypto-specific revenue to be about one-third of its Q1 level. Gaming notebooks also grew well, driven by an increasing number of thin and light notebooks based on our Max-Q design. Nintendo Switch contributed strongly to year-on-year growth, reflecting that platform's continued success.\",\n",
       "    'Moving to datacenter, we had another phenomenal quarter, with revenue of $701 million, up 71% year-on-year, up 16% sequentially. Demand was strong in all market segments and customers increasingly embraced our GPUs and CUDA platform for high performance computing and AI.',\n",
       "    'Adoption of our Volta architecture remains strong across a wide range of verticals and customers. In the public cloud segment, Microsoft Azure announced general availability of Tesla V100 inferences, joining Amazon, IBM, and Oracle, and Google Cloud announced that the V100 is now publicly available in Beta. Many other hyperscale and consumer internet companies also continued the ramp of Volta, which delivers 5 times the deep learning of its predecessor, Pascal. Volta has been chosen by every major cloud provider and server maker, reinforcing our leadership in AI deep learning.',\n",
       "    \"In high-performance computing, strength from the broad enterprise vertical more than offset the ramp-down of major supercomputing projects, such as the U.S. Department of Energy's Summit system. We see a strong pipeline across a number of vertical industries from manufacturing to oil and gas, which will help it sustain the trajectory of high-performance computing next quarter and beyond.\",\n",
       "    \"Traction is also increasing in AI inference. Inference GPU shipments to cloud service providers more that doubled from last quarter, and our pipeline is growing into next quarter. We dramatically increased our inference capabilities with the announcement of the TensorRT 4 AI inference accelerator software at our recent GPU technology conference in San Jose. TensorRT 4 accelerates deep learning inference up to 190 times faster than CPUs for common applications such as computer vision, neural machine translation, automatic speech recognition, speech synthesis, and recognition systems. It also dramatically expands the use cases prepared with the prior version. With TensorRT 4, NVIDIA's market reach has expanded to approximately 30 million hyperscale servers worldwide.\",\n",

Strength extended across several key industries, including public sector, healthcare, and retail. Key winds in the quarter included Columbia University using high-end QUADRO GPUs for AI and Siemens using them for CT and ultrasound solutions.',\n",
       "    'At GTC, we announced the QUADRO GV100 GPU with NVIDIA RTX technology, capable of delivering real-time ray tracing to the more than 25 million artists and designers throughout the world.

       "    'Okay. At this time, if you would like to ask a question, please press * then the number 1 on your telephone keypad. Again, that was *1 for questions. Your first question is from Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research.',\n",
       "    \"Jensen, why don't you start on the question for Stacy and I'll follow-up afterwards after you state.\",\n",
       "    \"Okay. Hi, Stacy. So, let's see. Q1. As you probably know, Fortnite and PUBG are global phenomena. The success of Fortnite and PUBG are just beyond comprehension, really. Those two games, a combination of Hunger Games and Survivor, you know, has just captures the imaginations of gamers all over the world. We saw the uptick and we saw the demand in our GPUs from all over the world. Surely, there was scarcity, as you know. Crypto miners bought a lot of our GPUs during the quarter and it drove prices up. I think that a lot of the gamers weren't able to buy into the new GeForces as a result.\",\n",
       "    \"We're starting to see the prices come down. We monitor spot pricing every single day around the world. The prices are starting to normalize. It's still higher than where they should be. So, obviously, the demand is still quite strong out there. But my sense is that there's a fair amount of pent-up demand still. Fortnite is still growing in popularity. PUBG is doing great. Then we've got some amazing titles coming out. My sense is that the overall gaming market is super healthy.\",\n",
       "    'Our job is to make sure that we work as hard as we can to get supply out into the marketplace and hopefully by doing that, the pricing will normalize and the gamers can buy into their favorite graphics card at a price that we hope they can get it at. The simple answer to your question is Fortnite and PUBG and the demand is really great. They did a great job.',\n",
       "    'Your next question is from Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley.',\n",
       "    \"Colette had talked about the inference doubling in sales quarter-over-quarter with cloud. Can you just talk about where you're seeing the early applications for inference? Is that sort of as a service business or are you looking at internal cloudware and just any color you can give us on where you guys are sitting in the inference space? Thank you.\",\n",
       "    \"Sure. Hi, Joe. As you know, there are 30 million servers around the world. They were put in place during the time when the world didn't have deep learning. Now with deep learning and now with machine learning approaches, the accuracy of prediction, the accuracy of recommendation has jumped so much, that just about every internet service provider in the world that has a lot of different customers and consumers are jumping onto this new software approach.\",\n",
       "    \"How you optimize for different neural networks, whether it's image recognition, speech recognition, natural language translation, recommendation systems, all of these networks have different architectures and the optimizing compiler that's necessary to make the neural network run smoothly and fast is incredibly complex. And so that's why we created TensorRT. That's what TensorRT is. TensorRT is an optimizing graph neural network compiler and it optimizes for each one of our platforms. Each one of our platforms has very different architectures.\",\n",
       "    \"For example, we reinvented the GPU and it's called a Tensor Core GPU and the first of its kind is called Volta. TensorRT 4.0 now supports, in addition to image recognition, all of the different types of neural network models. The answer to your question is internal consumption. Internal consumption is going to be the first users. Video recognition, detecting for inappropriate video, for example, all over the world, making recommendations from the videos that you search or the images that you're uploading. All of these types of applications are going to require an enormous amount of computation.\",\n",
       "    'The next question is from Vivek Arya with Bank of America.',\n",
       "    \"Thank you for taking my question and congratulations on the strong growth and consistent execution. Jensen, I have two questions about the data center. One from a growth and the second from a competition perspective. So, from the growth side, you guys are doing about say $3 billion or so annualized, but you have outlined a market that could be $50 billion. What needs to happen for the next inflection? Is it something in the market that needs to change? Is it something in the product set that needs to? How do you go and address that $50 billion market? Because you're only a few percent penetrated today in that large market. So, what needs to change for the next inflection point?\",\n",
       "    'Then on the competition side, as you are looking at that big market, how should we think about competition that is coming from some of your cloud customers, like Google announcing a TPU 3 or perhaps others looking at other competing technologies? Any color on both sort of how you look at growth and competition would be very helpful. Thank you.',\n",
       "    \"Thanks, Vivek. First of all, at its core, this is something we all know now. That CPU scaling has really slowed. If you think about the several hundred billion dollars' worth of computer equipment that's been installed in the cloud, in data centers all over the world, and as these applications for machine learning and high-performance computing approaches come along, the world needs a solution. CPU scaling has slowed. So, here is the approach that we pioneered a decade and a half ago called GPU computing, and we've been determined to continue to advance it during this time because we saw this day coming and we really believed that it was going to end. You can't definitely physics.\",\n",
       "    \"We find ourselves in a great position today. As Colette already mentioned, we have something close to a million developers on this platform now. It is incredibly fast, speeding up CPUs by 10, 20, 50 100 times, 200 times sometimes, depending on the algorithm. It's everywhere. The software ecosystem is just super-rich. As Colette mentioned, there's already almost a million developers around the world, that's grown 70% year-over-year.\",\n",
       "    \"We're doing more and more of our product designs in virtual reality. We want to simulate our products and simulate its capabilities in simulation in this computer rather than build it in the beginning. Then the last category would be graphics virtualization. We've taken with GRID and our QUADRO virtual workstation, and now with NVIDIA RTX, we've turned the data center into a powerful graphics super computer. So, these are the various applications and segments of data centers that we see.\",\n",
       "    \"I think in the case of training, we're limited by the number of deep learning experts in the world. That's growing very quickly. The frameworks are making it easier. There's a lot more open source and open documentation on sharing of knowledge and so the number of AI engineers around the world is growing super fast. The second is inference and I've already talked about that. It's really limited by our optimizing compilers and how we can target these neural network models to run our processors. If we can do so, we're going to save our customers enormous amounts of money. We speed up applications, we speed up these neural network models 50 times, 100 times, 200 times over a CPU. So, the more GPUs they buy, they're more they're going to save.\",\n",
       "    \"High-performance computing, the way to think about that is I think at this point, it's very clear that going forward, super computers are going to get built with accelerators in them. Because of our long-term dedication to CUDA and our GPUs for acceleration of all these codes and the nurturing of the ecosystem, I think that we're going to do super well in the super computing world. These are different verticals.\",\n",
       "    \"With respect to competition, it all starts with the core. The core is that the CPU scaling has slowed. The world needs another approach going forward. Surely, because of our focus on it, we find ourselves in a great position. Google announced TPU 3 and it's still behind our Tensor Core GPU. Our Volta is our first generation of a newly reinvented approach of doing GPUs. It's called Tensor Core GPUs. We're far ahead of the competition. But more than that, it's programmable. It's not one function; it's programmable. Not only is it faster, it's also more flexible. As a result of the flexibility, developers can use it in all kinds of applications, whether it's medical imaging or whether simulations, or deep learning, or computer graphics.\",\n",
       "    \"As a result, our GPUs are available in every cloud and every data center everywhere on the planet, which developers need that accessibility so that they can develop their software. So, I think that on the one hand, it's too simplistic to compare a TPU to just one of the many features that's in our Tensor Core GPU, but even if you did, we're faster, we support more frameworks, we support all neural networks. As a result, if you look at GitHub, there's some 60,000 different neural network research papers that are posted that run on NVIDIA GPUs. It's just a handful for the second alternative. That just gives you a sense of the reach and capabilities of our GPUs.\",\n",

       "    'Great, thank you so much. Jensen, I had a question regarding your decision to pull the plug on your GeForce partner program. I think most of us read your blog from last Friday, I think it was, so we understand the basic background, but if you can describe what led to this decision and perhaps talk a little bit about the potential implications, if any, in terms of your ability to compete or gain share, that would be really helpful. Thank you so much.',\n",

I have a question on HPC.[Inaudible]on the recent call raised their accelerator attach rate forecast on HPC to 50% from mid-teens. I would love to get further details on what exactly NVIDIA is doing to software services, etc. that's kind of creating this competitive positioning in HPC and AI, basically. Then if I could ask a follow-up, basically, on benchmarks. So, there's been some news on AI benchmarks, whether it's[inaudible], etc., so I would love to get your thoughts on (a) the current state of benchmarks for AI workloads; and (b) the relative positioning of[inaudible]versus GPUs, especially as we move toward newer networks like[inaudible], etc. Thank you.\",\n",
       "    \"Our GPU approach, because of its flexibility, because of its performance, because of the value that we create, as a result of the throughput of a data center, we save people so much money, just in cables alone. Oftentimes, it more than pays for the GPUs that they buy. The reason for that is because the number of servers reduce dramatically. So, I think the future of HPC is about acceleration and the NVIDIA CUDA GPUs are really in a great position to serve this vacuum that's been created.\",\n",
       "    'And so, you need a lot of software capability and the versatility of your platform needs to be great. We also have a lot of expertise in the company in software. NVIDIA is really a full stack computing company. From architecture to system software, to algorithms, to applications, we have a great deal of expertise across the entire stack. And so, we love these complicated benchmarks that are out there and I think this is great way for us to simplify our leadership position.',\n",

       "    'Thanks for my question. I wanted to ask on the inference side of[inaudible]and beyond autos when we look at sizing that TAM, what are the other big areas that you think you can penetrate with GPUs and[inaudible]besides autos?',\n",
       "    \"Blayne, the largest inference opportunity for us is actually in the cloud in the data center. That's the first great opportunity. The reason for that is there's just an explosion in the number of different types of neural networks that are available. There is imagine recognition, there is video sequencing, there's recommender systems, there's speech recognition, speech synthesis, natural language understanding. There's just so many different types of neural networks that are being created.\",\n",
       "    \"Creating one ASIC that can be adapted to all of these different types of networks is just a real challenge. By the time that you create such a thing, it's called a Tensor Core GPU, which is what we created. So, I think the first opportunity for us in large scale opportunity will be in the data center in the cloud.\",\n",
       "    \"The second will be in vertical markets. The vertical market you mentioned is self-driving cars. We see a great opportunity in autonomous vehicles, and I've mentioned that before. Between now and the time that we ramp our AV computers we call DRIVE, we're going to be selling a whole lot of servers so that companies could develop their neural network models for their self-driving cars, as well as simulating virtual reality. There are various test drives. As well as testing their neural network and their self-driving car stack against billions and billions of miles of saved up, pre-recorded videos. And so, in the vertical markets, we're going to see inference both in the data center for developing the self-driving car stack, as well as in the self-driving cars themselves.\",\n",
       "    \"Now, in the self-driving cars, the ASPs for Level 2 could be a few hundred dollars to a Level 5 self-driving car, taxi, or driverless taxi being a few thousand dollars. I expect that driverless taxis will start going to market about 2019 and self-driving cars probably somewhere between 2020 and 2021. I think the size of the market is fairly well modeled. The simple way to think about that is I believe that everything that moves someday will be autonomous or have autonomous capabilities. So, the 100 million cars, the countless taxis, all the trucks, all the agriculture equipment, all the pizza delivery vehicles. You name it. Everything is going to be autonomous and the market opportunity is going to be quite large. That's the reason why we're so determined to go create that market.\",\n",

       "    \"Thank you. I actually wanted to go back to the question about seasonality for gaming in June. Normal seasonal sounds like it's up mid-teens for June in gaming, but obviously the comps are skewed a little bit because of the channel restock and the crypto stuff. Does the guidance for June assume that gaming is better or worse than that mid-teens normal seasonal? Thank you.\",\n",
       "    \"We are expecting Q2 to be better than seasonality, if I understand your question. We're expecting Q2 to be better than Q1, and we're expecting Q2 to be better than seasonality. Did that answer your question?\",\n",

       "    'Hi, thanks for taking my question and good job on the results. I have a question for Colette. Colette, first, thank you for breaking out crypto sales in the OEM line and guide for us. I have a question on your gross margins. Your gross margins have been expanding on product mix, despite component pricing headwinds on the D-Ram side. When do you expect component pricing to become a tailwind for your gross margin?',\n",
       "    \"Thanks so much for the question. When you think about our gross margins just over this last quarter, as you know, we were working on stabilizing the overall supply that was out there in the market for consumer GPUs. We benefited from that with a higher gross margin, as we filled and completed that. You've seen us absorb a significant amount of the component pricing changes that we have seen, particularly around the memory. We're not here to be able to forecast generally when those pricing for those components will stabilize. But we believe in terms of the value added that our platforms provide the components are an important part of finishing that, but I think we have a tremendous amount more value that we are adding in terms of the software on top of our platforms, which is enabling our gross margins.\",\n",

You talked in your prepared remarks about 5 deployments, including the Google beta. Can you talk about how soon we can expect to see some of those remaining deployments? Of those already launched, how far are they along? What, I'd guess you'd say proverbially, what inning are we in in these deployments?\",\n",
       "    \"Yeah, so first of all, Volta is a reinvented GPU. Volta is the world's first GPU that has been designed to be incredibly good at deep learning. We call it the Tensor Core GPU. It still retains all of the flexibilities of everything that CUDA's ever run is backwards compatible with everything that runs on CUDA, but it has new architectures designed to be incredibly good at deep learning. We call it a Tensor Core GPU. That's the reason why it has all of the benefits of our GPU, but none of the ASICs can catch up to it. And so, Volta is really a breakthrough. We're going to be very successful with Volta. Every cloud will have it.\",\n",
       "    \"The initial deployment is for internal consumption. Volta has been shipping to the cloud providers, the internet service companies, for the vast majority of the last quarter, as you guys know. They're using it internally. Now they're starting to open up Volta for external consumption to their cloud customers. They're moving as fast as they can.

Our own fieldwork is indicating very positive reception for DGX and I was wondering if you could help us understand the high growth you've seen in the data center versus to what extent is that being driven by the DGX and what, when DGX-2 starts to ramp in the back half of the year, is this something that kind of layers on top of DGX? Does DGX-2 layer on top of DGX? Are[inaudible]being segmented in the market or are these different products? Any color on how to think about those two products[inaudible]would be helpful.

I was wondering, Jensen, if you could help us understand the high growth you've seen in the data center market, how much is DGX contributing to that? And then when DGX-2 starts to ramp in the second half of the year, how do we think about DGX 1? Does it replace the original DGX or are you going after different segments? Do they layer on top of one another? Any color on that would be helpful. Thank you.\",\n",
       "    \"I see. Thank you. DGX-2 and DGX-1 will both be in the market at the same time. DGX is a few hundred million dollar business. It was introduced last year, so its growth rate is obviously very high. It's designed for enterprises where they need to have their computers on premise, but they don't want to build a super computer and they don't have the expertise to do so. They would like to pull a super computer out of a box, plug it in, and start doing super computing.\",\n",
       "    \"And so, DGX is really designed for enterprises. We're seeing great success there.

       "    \"Hey, guys. I'm actually going to go with a more nitty-gritty question just on the financial side, just to make sure I'm understanding this right. So, the OEM beat was pretty material, given a lot of crypto revenue. Is it still the case that OEM is materially lower gross margin than your corporate average at this time?\",\n",
       "    \"Sure, I'll take that question. Generally, our OEM business can be a little bit of volatile because, remember, OEM business incorporates our mainstream GPUs, as well as our Tegra Integrated. So, we have development platforms that we sell on some of the Tegra piece of it, but they are slightly below and I think you can go back and refer to our discussion at Investor Day, as there was a slide there that talks about those embedded pieces, and then being below.\",\n",

       "    \"Hey, guys. Thanks for the question. So, your competitor thinks that just 10% of their sales were from crypto, or like $150, $160 million. You guys did almost $300 million there. Perhaps, I think, there could actually be some in gaming as well, which would imply that you guys have two-thirds or more of that market? So, I guess, what's going on there? Is there a pricing dynamic that's allowing you to have such share there or do you think it's your competitors that don't know what's actually being sold to miners versus gamers? Why such implied share in that market? Thanks.\",\n",
       "    \"Well, we try to as transparently reveal our numbers as we can. Our strategy is to create a skew that allows the crypto miners to fulfill their needs and we call it CMP. As much as possible, fill their demand that way. Sometimes it's just not possible because the demand is too great. But we try to do so. We try to keep the miners on the CMP skews as much as we can. I'm not exactly sure how other people do it, but that's the warranty we do it.\",\n",

       "    \"Thanks for sneaking me in and congratulations on all the financial records in the quarter. Jensen, I just wanted to come back to an announcement that you made at GTC with ray tracing. Because the technology looked like it was very high fidelity and I think you noted at the time it was very computationally intensive. So the question is, as we think about the gaming business and the potential for ray tracing to enter that platform group, what does it mean for dynamics that we've seen in the past, for example, the ability to really push the high end of the market with high-end capability 1070 TI had launched last year; it was very successful. Does this give you further flexibility for those types of launches as you bring exciting and very high-end technology to market? Thank you.\",\n",
       "    \"Yeah, I appreciate it. NVIDIA RTX is the biggest computer graphics invention in the last 15 years. It took us a decade to do. We literally worked on it continuously for one decade. To put it in perspective, it's basically film rendering, cinematic rendering, except it's in real time. It merges the style of computer graphics, restorization, and life simulation, what people call ray tracing, as well as deep learning and AI, and merged it into one, unified framework so that we can achieve cinematic rendering in real time. What is currently takes is a server about a few hours, depending on the scene, it might take as long as a full day, take a few hours to render one frame.\",\n",
       "    \"Then, of course, architecture design and car design. The number of applications, the number of industries that are built on top of modern computer graphics is really quite large. I'm certain that NVIDIA RTX is going to impact every single one of them. So, that's our starting point is to dramatically reduce the cost of film rendering, dramatically reduce the time that it takes to do it, and hopefully more GPU servers will be purchased and, of course, better content will be created. Long-term, we've also now plotted the path toward doing it in real time. Someday, we will be able to put RTX into a GeForce gaming card and the transformation to the revolution to the gaming industry will be quite extraordinary. We're super excited about RTX.\",\n",

       "    \"Hi, guys. Thanks for fitting me in for my follow-up. This is a question for Colette. I want to follow up again on the seasonality. I'm understanding the prior comments. Normal seasonal for Q2 for gaming would be up in the double digits. Given your commentary on the crypto decline into Q2, given your commentary on just the general drivers around data center and the Volta ramps, I can't bring that together with the idea of gaming being above seasonal within the context of your guidance envelope. How should I reconcile those things? How are you actually thinking about seasonality for gaming into Q2 within the context of the scenarios that are currently contemplated in your guidance for next quarter?\",\n",
       "    \"Sure, Stacy. Let me see if I can bridge together Jensen and then some comments here. Unfortunately, they're moving quite fast to the next question, so I wasn't able to add on. But let me see if I can add on here and present a little bit of clarity in terms of the seasonality. Remember, in Q1, we outgrew seasonality significantly. We left Q4 with very low inventory in terms of the new channel. We spent Q1 working on establishing a decent amount of inventory available. We wanted to concentrate on our miners separately. You can see we did that in terms of Q1 by moving that to OEM and moving that to cryptocurrency only boards.\",\n",
       "    \"So, we left Q1 at this point with healthy overall channel inventory levels as far as where we stand. That then takes you now to Q2. But, if we overshot in terms of seasonality in terms of Q1, we don't have to do those channel fill dynamics again as we get into Q2. But we do have demand out there for our gamers that we can now address very carefully with the overall inventory that we now have available. So, putting together Q1 and Q2 together, yes, we are within normal seasonality. Again, for a guidance, and we'll see how we'll finish in terms of the quarter, but you should be in that range. So, yes, from a normal seasonality at a year-to-date inclusive of Q2? Yes, we're on that overall seasonality.\",\n",
       "    \"Always keep in mind generally our H2s are usually higher than our overall H1s. That's what you should think about our overall guidance. Gaming is still strong. We have to comment that our overall drivers that have taken us to this place over the last 3 to 5 years with phenomenal growth and our ability to grow that overall market is still here and all of those things are together. We've just had a few quarters in terms of making sure that we get the overall channel correct and put our miners separately. I hope that clarifies in terms of where we are in terms of gaming seasonality.\",\n",
       "    'Your last question comes from Will Stein with SunTrust.',\n",
       "    \"Great, thank you for taking my question and squeezing me in. The question relates to the supply chain challenges that you've talked so much about in the gaming end market. I'm wondering if there's something particular to that end market that is making the shortages concentrated there or are, in fact, other end markets, in particular the data center end market also somewhat restricted from what growth they might have achieved if there weren't the shortages that are out there, and maybe talk about the pace of recovery of those, that'd be really helpful. Thanks so much.\",\n",
       "    \"Let me start off here and I'll have Jensen finish up on the last part of that question. But overall, our data center business did phenomenal. Volta is doing extremely well and even now with 32-bit, we're seeing tremendous adoption throughout. Again, remember it's very different than the overall consumer business. We have significant amount of time for qualification and that is moving extremely fast based on a lot of other industries and their ability to qualify. So, no, there is not a supply challenge at all in terms of the data center and our overall growth in data center we're extremely pleased with in terms of how the quarter came out. I'll turn it over to you, Jensen, and you can answer the rest of the part of it?\",\n",
       "    \"Yeah, the reason why miners love GeForce is because miners are everywhere in the world. One of the benefits of cryptocurrency is that it's not any sovereign currency. It's in the digital world. It's distributed. GeForce is the single, largest distributed supercomputing infrastructure on the planet. Every gamer has a super computer in their PC. GeForce is so broadly distributed, it's available everywhere. And so, GeForce is really a good candidate for any new cryptocurrency or any new cryptography algorithm that comes along.\",\n",
       "    \"We try the best we can to go directly to the major miners. They represent the vast majority of the demand. To the best of our ability, we serve their needs directly and we call that CMP and that's why it's not called GeForce, they're called CMP. We can serve those miners directly, hopefully to take some of the demand pressure off of the GeForce market because ultimately, what we would like is we would like the market for GeForce pricing to come down so that the gamers could benefit from the GeForces that we built for them and the gaming demand is strong. The bottom line is Fortnite is a home run. The bottom line is PUBG is a home run. The number of gamers that are enjoying these games is really astronomic, as people know very well.\",\n",
       "    \"It's a global phenomenon. These two games are equally fun in Asia as it is in Europe, as it is in the United States. Because you team up and this is a battle royale, you'd rather play with your friends, so it's incredibly social. It's incredibly sticky. More gamers that play, more of their friends join and more of their friends join, more gamers that play. So it's this positive feedback system. The guys at Epic did a fantastic job of creating Fortnite. It's just a wonderful game genre that people are really enjoying.\",\n",
       "    \"I think at the core of it, the gaming is strong and we're looking forward to inventory normalizing in the channel so that pricing could normalize in the channel, so that gamers can come back to buy the GeForce card that is now been in short supply for over a quarter. And so the pent-up demand is quite significant and I'm expecting the gamers to be able to buy new GeForces pretty soon.\",\n",

And we continue to see very positive trends in the June quarter with TV+ viewership up strong double digits year-over-year. In June, we were also thrilled to release F1 in theaters around the world, one of the summer's most unforgettable blockbusters. During the quarter, we celebrated a big anniversary with 10 years of Apple Music. To mark the occasion, we launched an all-new studio space in Los Angeles for artists to create content and connect with fans.\",\n",
       "    \"And later this year, we're bringing Apple Music users even more to love from an enhanced listening experience with AutoMix, which mixes songs like a DJ to lyrics translation and more. The App Store meanwhile continues to be the very best place to discover the latest apps from developers around the world in a safe and trusted way and App Store revenue grew double digits year-over-year, setting a June quarter record. In retail, we continue to find opportunities in emerging markets to connect with even more customers. We recently launched the Apple Store online in Saudi Arabia, and we couldn't be more excited to open new stores in the UAE and India later this year.\",\n",
       "    \"We were also delighted to welcome customers in Japan to a new location in the heart of Osaka. Across everything we do at Apple, we show up by leading with our values. We feel strongly that the benefits of technology should be shared by everyone. That's why we make technology for everyone. In May, to mark Global Accessibility Awareness Day, we announced updates to help users learn, connect and interact with their worlds, including magnifier for Mac, a new braille experience and accessibility reader, a new system-wide reading mode to make it easier to understand content.\",\n",
       "    \"And we're proud to introduce accessibility nutrition labels, giving users an understanding of accessibility features before they download an app while helping developers educate people on features their app support. This month, we also announced a $0.5 billion commitment with MP Materials to strengthen the supply of vital recycled rare earth materials in the U.S. and support American industry. And in August, we're opening our all-new Apple Manufacturing Academy in Detroit to train and support American manufacturers. These investments are part of Apple's largest ever spend commitment, which we announced earlier this year.\",\n",

We're proud of this work and all that we're doing to tap into American innovation and bring the best technology experiences to users across the globe. And we continue to look for further opportunities to do even more. Finally, the situation around tariffs is evolving, so let me provide some color there. For the June quarter, we incurred approximately $800 million of tariff-related costs.\",\n",

This estimate should not be used to make projections for future quarters as there are many factors that could change, including tariff rates. We're really proud of our results for the June quarter, and I want to thank our teams and our customers. In everything we do, we're driven by transformative innovation, delivering the most exceptional products and services we've ever created, and we're especially excited about what's ahead. With that, I'll turn it over to Kevan.\",\n",
       "    'Kevan Parekh:Thanks, Tim, and good afternoon, everyone. Our revenue of $94 billion was up 10% year-over-year and is a new June quarter record. We grew in every geographic segment and in the vast majority of the markets we track. Products revenue was $66.6 billion, up 8% year-over-year, driven by growth across iPhone and Mac. And thanks to our high levels of customer satisfaction and strong loyalty, our installed base of active devices reached another all-time high across all product categories and geographic segments. Services revenue was $27.4 billion, up 13% year-over-year and an all-time record. We saw strength across the world with double-digit growth in the majority of our markets.',\n",
       "    'Company gross margin was 46.5% at the high end of our guidance range and down 60 basis points sequentially, primarily driven by approximately $800 million in tariff-related costs Tim mentioned earlier. Products gross margin was 34.5%, down 140 basis points sequentially, driven by mix and tariff-related costs, partly offset by cost savings. Services gross margin was 75.6%, down 10 basis points sequentially. Operating expenses landed at $15.5 billion, up 8% year- over-year. This strong business performance led to June quarter records for both net income at $23.4 billion and diluted earnings per share of $1.57, which was up 12% year-over-year. Operating cash flow was also strong at $27.9 billion.',\n",
       "    \"Now I'm going to provide some more details for each of our revenue categories. iPhone revenue was $44.6 billion, up 13% year-over- year, driven by the iPhone 16 family. As Tim noted, we saw iPhone growth in every geographic segment and double-digit growth in many emerging markets. The iPhone active installed base grew to an all-time high in total and in every geographic segment, and we reached a June quarter record for upgraders. According to a recent survey from Worldpanel, formerly of Kantar, iPhone was a top-selling model in the U.S., Urban China, the U.K., Australia and Japan during the June quarter.\",\n",
       "    'And we continue to see very high levels of customer satisfaction in the U.S. at 98% as measured by 451 Research. Mac revenue was $8 billion, up 15% year-over-year, driven by continued strength across the portfolio, including MacBook Air, Mac mini and MacBook Pro. We grew in every geographic segment and saw double-digit growth in Europe, Greater China and the rest of Asia Pacific. The Mac installed base reached an all-time high, and we hit a June quarter record for upgraders.',\n",
       "    \"In the U.S., customer satisfaction was recently measured at 97%. iPad revenue was $6.6 billion, down 8% year-over-year, which was expected given the difficult compare against the launch of the iPad Air and iPad Pro in the year ago quarter. At the same time, the iPad installed base reached another all-time high and over half of the customers who purchased an iPad during the quarter were new to the product. And based on the latest reports from 451 Research, customer satisfaction was 98% in the U.S. Wearables, Home and Accessories revenue was $7.4 billion, down 9% year-over-year. This was driven by a difficult compare on accessories due to the prior year's iPad launches that I just referred to.\",\n",
       "    'The Apple Watch installed base reached a new all-time high with over half of customers purchasing an Apple Watch during the quarter being new to the product. We also set a quarterly record for upgraders on Apple Watch and the latest customer satisfaction for Watch in the U.S. was reported at 97%. Our Services revenue reached an all-time high of $27.4 billion, up 13% year-over-year. The performance in the June quarter was broad-based. We saw a sequential acceleration across the majority of the categories, including cloud services, where we reached an all-time revenue record, driven by the year-over-year growth of iCloud paying accounts.',\n",
       "    'We saw strong momentum during the June quarter and the growth of our installed base of active devices gives us great opportunities for the future. Customer engagement across our Services offerings also continued to grow. Both transacting and paid accounts reached new all- time highs with paid accounts growing double digits year-over-year. Paid subscriptions also grew double digits. We have well over 1 billion paid subscriptions across the Services on our platform. We continue to improve the quality and breadth of our Service offerings from the new Apple Games app to a continued expansion of Tap to Pay and Wallet. Turning to enterprise. Organizations are continuing to invest in Apple products to drive employee innovation and productivity.',\n",
       "    \"With companies like PayPal and Roche deploying more Macs for their workforce, we had the best June quarter ever for Mac in enterprise. In Thailand, Siam Commercial Bank, one of the largest Thai banks, has deployed thousands of iPads across their branches to enhance the quality and efficiency of their banking operations from loan services to wealth management. CAE, a leader in pilot training and simulation technology is using Apple Vision Pro to enable pilots to become more familiar with aircraft procedures, leading to more productive in-person flight simulator training outcomes. Let's turn to our cash position and capital return program. We ended the quarter with $133 billion in cash and marketable securities.\",\n",
       "    \"We had $5.7 billion of debt maturities, issued $4.5 billion of new debt and increased commercial paper by $4 billion, resulting in $102 billion in total debt. Therefore, at the end of the quarter, net cash was $31 billion. During the quarter, we returned over $27 billion to shareholders. This included $3.9 billion in dividends and equivalents and $21 billion through open market repurchases of 104 million Apple shares. As we move into the September quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Suhasini referred to.\",\n",
       "    \"Importantly, the color we're providing assumes that the global tariff rates, policies and application remain in effect as of this call, the global macroeconomic outlook does not worsen from today and the current revenue share agreement with Google continues. We expect our September quarter total company revenue to grow mid- to high single digits year-over-year. We expect Services revenue to grow at a year-over-year rate similar to what we reported in the June quarter. We expect gross margin to be between 46% and 47%, which includes the estimated impact of the $1.1 billion tariff-related costs that Tim referred to earlier. We expect operating expenses to be between $15.6 billion and $15.8 billion.\",\n",
       "    \"We expect OI&E to be around negative $25 million, excluding any potential impact from the mark-to-market of minority investments and our tax rate to be around 17%. Finally, today, our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.26 per share of common stock payable on August 14, 2025, to shareholders of record as of August 11, 2025. With that let's open the call to questions.\",\n",
       "    'Suhasini Chandramouli:Thank you, Kevan.[Operator Instructions]. Operator, may we have the first question, please?',\n",
       "    \"Operator:Certainly, we'll go ahead and take our first question from Michael Ng with Goldman Sachs.\",\n",
       "    \"Michael Ng:I just have one on upgrade rates and one on CapEx. First, on the upgrade rates, it's encouraging to see the records on iPhone, Mac and Watch. I was wondering if you're seeing strength in the upgrade rates? Or is the records more a function of the growing installed base? What is your research showing that made upgrades particularly compelling this year? For example, is it product features, tariff pull forward, perhaps Apple Intelligence? And then I'll give my follow-up on CapEx.\",\n",
       "    \"Timothy D. Cook:You'll do CapEx first.\",\n",
       "    \"Kevan Parekh:Yes, I'll do CapEx first.\",\n",
       "    \"Michael Ng:Just on the CapEx, it's up notably year-to-date. Could you just comment on your capital spending plan this year and next and provide some qualitative color in terms of what's driving that growth? Is it AI-related or supply chain diversification, for instance?\",\n",
       "    \"Kevan Parekh:Yes, Mike, it's a combination of factors. I would say, a pretty significant driver as Tim talked about, is the fact we are increasing our investment significantly in AI. So that is certainly a component of it. As you know, we've been investing in private cloud compute, which is also in our first-party data centers. The other piece, as you know, is we do have a hybrid strategy where in cases we do use third parties to make capital investments, and we also invest in our own. So you are going to see an increase in CapEx.\",\n",
       "    \"We also, from time to time, have other investments in facilities, in toolings, but I would say a significant portion of the driver of growth that you're seeing now is really driven by some of our AI-related investments.\",\n",
       "    'Timothy D. Cook:On the upgrades, Michael, if you look at iPhone, the 16 family grew double digit as opposed to the 15 family from the year ago quarter. And so we did set an upgrade record. I think it directly is because of the strength of the product. Mac also set records on upgrade, and I think we continue to see a move to Apple silicon and the performance of Apple silicon is playing a very key role. And so it was an incredible quarter.',\n",
       "    'Operator:Our next question is from Erik Woodring with Morgan Stanley.',\n",
       "    \"Erik William Richard Woodring:I have two as well. Tim maybe starting with you, shortly after March quarter earnings, there were some reports about searches on Safari declining in April for the first time, I think, in over 2 decades. Judging by your 13% Services growth this quarter, it doesn't seem to indicate that April trends necessarily played out through the remainder of the June quarter. And so I'm really just looking for a little bit more color on really how the rest of the quarter played out. And if you believe Apple products as kind of search access points are losing their strategic value as AI platforms become more valuable, popular or increasing in strategic value. And then I have a follow-up.\",\n",
       "    \"Timothy D. Cook:I think they continue to be very valuable. I think that consumers' behaviors are evolving, and we're monitoring it very closely.\",\n",
       "    \"Erik William Richard Woodring:Okay. I appreciate that color. And then maybe second to that, I'd love if you could maybe elaborate a bit on what you're seeing in China. I think in an interview earlier this afternoon, you alluded to some of the promotions being tailwinds. But just bigger picture, if we take a step back in China, how would you characterize demand interest in the iPhone 16 and some of your other products? Is that shifting or maybe were some of the trends in the June quarter maybe a bit more onetime and unique in nature?\",\n",
       "    'Operator:Our next question is from Ben Reitzes with Melius Research.',\n",
       "    \"Benjamin Alexander Reitzes:I really appreciate it. I wanted to ask about Siri, Tim, and just overall AI investment. There's a perception that Siri is going to help drive other new products potentially that maybe where voice is quite needed. And just wondering how's your confidence towards launching that next year? Is there anything that's been done internally to increase that confidence? Is it tied to the investment? I just think folks would love to know a little bit more about your confidence in how that's going? And then I have a follow-up.\",\n",
       "    \"Timothy D. Cook:Yes. Thanks for the question. We're making good progress on a more personalized Siri, and we do expect to release the features next year, as we had said earlier, our focus from an AI point of view is on putting AI features across the platform that are deeply personal, private and seamlessly integrated. And of course, we've done that with more than 20 Apple Intelligence features so far from visual intelligence to cleanup to writing tools and all the rest. We are significantly growing our investment, we did during the June quarter, we will again in the September quarter.\",\n",
       "    'Kevan Parekh:Yes, Ben, this is Kevan. Thanks for the question. I think when you look at the growth from Q3, we just reported to the mid- to high single-digit guide. I think you have to kind of keep in mind two components. The first is the effect of the tariff-related pull-ahead in demand that Tim referenced earlier, which we estimated to be about 1 point of the 10 points that we ended up doing in Q3. And then the other factor that I think you have to take into consideration is the fact that in September quarter a year ago, we had the full quarter impact of the iPad launches, which also leads to a difficult compare this year.',\n",
       "    'So those two components are things you have to take into consideration as you think about the move from Q3 to Q4. I would say foreign exchange is a very minor tailwind going from Q3 to Q4, so not really a major factor.',\n",
       "    'Operator:Our next question is from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. .',\n",
       "    \"Timothy D. Cook:Yes, Wamsi, I don't really want to speculate on the court ruling and how they would rule and what we would do as a consequence of it.\",\n",
       "    \"Wamsi Mohan:Okay. Okay. I guess we'll wait for that ruling to come out. I guess, separately, Tim, at a high level, when you look at some of what is perceived fears of new form factors and ways to interact with devices. There was some worry that given some of the developments in AI that there could be a world where dependence on screen-based devices significantly diminishes. And I'm kind of curious to get your thoughts on if do you think that would happen and rate and pace in which? And how do you think Apple is preparing in that case?\",\n",
       "    \"Timothy D. Cook:When you think about all the things an iPhone can do from connecting people to bringing app and game experiences to life to taking photos and videos to helping users explore the world and conduct their financial lives and pay for things and so much more. It's difficult to see a world where iPhone is not living in it. And that doesn't mean that we are not thinking about other things as well. But I think that, that the devices are likely to be complementary devices, not substitution.\",\n",
       "    'Operator:Our next question is from Amit Daryanani with Evercore.',\n",
       "    'And so we continue to explore these things and look for more that we can do, which I think ultimately is the objective.',\n",
       "    'Amit Jawaharlaz Daryanani:Got it. Super helpful. And then your Services growth, I think, was extremely impressive at 13%, especially given all the fears folks had. Can you just touch on, did you see any impact that was notable from the Epic case and the steering dynamics that came after that? And maybe just touch on what does that appeal process looks like for you as you go forward? .',\n",
       "    'Kevan Parekh:Yes, this is Kevan. Let me take that one. In general, I think just reminding, I think you just said, we had a very strong Services quarter, we had an all-time record at the $27.4 billion, up 13%. The one thing I would also say is our services performance was broad- based. So we also saw strength in developed and emerging markets, both parts of the world had double-digit growth. We also saw a sequential acceleration across the majority of our categories, including cloud services, where I mentioned in the prepared remarks that we had an all-time revenue record.',\n",
       "    'Operator:Our next question is from David Vogt with UBS.',\n",
       "    \"David Vogt:And I have two questions as well. Maybe Tim, just on the supply chain strategy. I know last quarter, you talked about focusing production or assembly to India. And I just want to get an update on how you're thinking about the strategy holistically, given sort of the tariff rates, I think, in India potentially are higher than I think anyone had expected. So I know you mentioned some U.S. investments, would love to kind of get your thoughts on how you're thinking about China versus the rest of Southeast Asia and India going forward? And then I'll give you my second question also.\",\n",
       "    \"There hasn't been a change to that, which is the vast majority of the iPhone sold in the U.S. or the majority, I should say, have a country of origin of India and the vast majority of the products, other products, the Mac and the iPad and the Watch have a country of origin of Vietnam that are sold in the United States. Still, the products for other international countries, the vast majority of them are coming from China. And so that hopefully gives you a flavor of the of where things are. But I would stress again that we do a lot in this country in the United States.\",\n",
       "    'Kevan Parekh:And then, David, as...',\n",
       "    'David Vogt:And then on the iPhone activity?',\n",
       "    \"Kevan Parekh:Yes. So I was going to mention the iPhone activity. You asked if there's any kind of unique characteristics this quarter? I would just say, as Tim outlined, we really believe that the strong upgrade performance, which was a June quarter record was really driven by the strength of the product lineup. The iPhone 16 family has done incredibly well compared to the iPhone 15 family. And we also, as you recall, recently introduced the 16e as well, which also continued to impact the success of the overall iPhone 16 lineup.\",\n",
       "    'Operator:Our next question is from Krish Sankar with TD Cowen.',\n",
       "    'Krish Sankar:I have two of them. The first one is for Kevan, this was a previous question, do you think there was any pull-in of iPhones in the June quarter that led to some of the upside? And how to think about channel inventory in June quarter? And how it looks in September relative to seasonal trends? And then I had a longer-term follow-up for Tim.',\n",
       "    \"Timothy D. Cook:Let me see if I can answer the channel inventory question or what I think is the channel inventory question. If you look at iPhone channel inventory from the beginning of the quarter to the end of the quarter, we reduced it, and it ended toward the low end of our targeted range. And so that's the answer on the inventory piece of it.\",\n",
       "    'Kevan Parekh:And then I think you also asked about the pull-ahead impact. I think we referenced that earlier. Just to be clear on what we believe we saw in the June quarter, we did see some obvious signs of pull-ahead really in the April time frame around the tariff-related discussions that were out in the marketplace. And so we felt that, that was from what we saw about a 1 point impact of the 10 points at a total company level of growth. And so that was the limited impact that we believe we saw for the quarter.',\n",
       "    \"Timothy D. Cook:The way that we look at AI is that it's one of the most profound technologies of our lifetime. And I think it will affect all devices in a significant way. What pieces of the chain are commoditized and not commoditized, I wouldn't want to really talk about today because that gives away some things on our strategy. But I think it's a good question.\",\n",
       "    'Operator:Our next question is from Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan.',\n",
       "    'Operator:Our next question is from Aaron Rakers from Wells Fargo.',\n",
       "    \"Aaron Christopher Rakers:I've got two as well, and I'll just ask them together. I guess the first one is just more housekeeping. Kevan, when we think about currency impact, how much of a benefit was currency this quarter, and I guess across the business and in particular, maybe on the Services segment, and on a year-on-year basis, how much currency benefit should we be thinking about embedded in the guidance into the September quarter? And then the second quick question is CapEx is clearly moving higher. I know you guys don't guide specifically to that number.\",\n",
       "    \"And then on the second question, sure, on the CapEx side, I think we talked about the fact that we are, and Tim mentioned the fact that we are increasing our investment significantly in AI. You are going to continue to see our CapEx grow. It's not going to be exponential growth, but it is going to grow substantially. And a lot of that's a function of the investments we're making in AI. As we mentioned, we also have other items that fall under that category, facilities and some of our retail store investments. But I would say a lot of the growth is really being driven by AI.\",\n",
       "    'I would remind you that we do have a hybrid model though, where we also leverage third-party infrastructure in addition to investing in our own first-party infrastructure.',\n",
       "    'Operator:Our next question is from Atif Malik with Citi.',\n",
       "    'Atif Malik:Tim, at the WWDC earlier in the quarter, you showed impressive updates on Vision Pro with the use of widget, spatial scenes, persona and new ways to create content. Appears like Meta and Xiaomi are seeing strong momentum on their AI glasses. So is the focus still around enterprises on Vision Pro? Or are you thinking of broadening the use cases and maybe tying it to more of your devices? Any thoughts on Vision Pro as they did not get enough airtime in the prepared remarks.',\n",
       "    \"Timothy D. Cook:Yes. Thanks for bringing it up. I was thrilled with the release from the team on visionOS 26. It includes many things in it like spatial widgets to enable users to customize their digital space. The personas took a huge increase. They're much more lifelike. And of course, there's new enterprise APIs for companies as well. And we're seeing, as Kevan talked about in his opening remarks, we're seeing those things resonate out with CAE and other customers. And so we continue to be very focused on it. And I don't want to get into the road map on it, but this is an area that we really believe in.\",\n",
       "    'Atif Malik:Great. And Kevan, historically, you guys have not done much big M&A. Do you feel like you need to accelerate your AI road map or just keep the organic focus?',\n",
       "    \"Timothy D. Cook:Let me take that one as well. We've acquired around seven companies this year. And that's companies from all walks of life, not all AI oriented. And so we're doing one, think of it as one every several weeks. We're very open to M&A that accelerates our road map. We are not stuck on a certain size company, although the ones that we have acquired thus far this year are small in nature. But we basically ask ourselves whether a company can help us accelerate a road map. If they do, then we're interested, but we don't have anything to share specifically today.\",\n",

Despite that headwind, we expect our March quarter total company revenue to grow low to mid single digits year over year. We expect services revenue to grow low double digits year over year.\",\n",
       "    'When you remove the negative impact of the foreign exchange headwinds I described earlier, the year-over-year growth rate would be comparable to that of the December quarter. We expect gross margin to be between 46.5% and 47.5%. We expect operating expenses to be between $15.1 billion and $15.3 billion. We expect OI&E to be around negative $300 million, excluding any potential impact from the mark-to-market of minority investments and our tax rate to be around 16%.',\n",

       "    'And so, we see all of those being used. The Clean Up is another one that is popular, and people love seeing that when demoed in the stores as well. We only had two, two and a half weeks or so during the December quarter of the second release of 18.2. And then, only had the U.K.',\n",

       "    'Yeah, sure. If you look at our greater China revenue for the quarter, we were down 11% year over year. And over half of the decline that we experienced was driven by change in channel inventory from the beginning to the end of the quarter. And, of course, on the Apple Intelligence side, we have not rolled out in China.',\n",

       "    \"It's a good question. iPad overall grew 15% for the quarter. And it was more driven by iPad Air and the entry-level iPad than it was the top-level iPad. But overall, we could not be more pleased with the iPad category growing 15%.\",\n",
       "    \"It's a great achievement for the quarter. And probably, what is most important is that over half of the sales in the December quarter went to customers who were new to the iPad. So, that tells us that, you know, there's a good amount of customers there to attract.\",\n",

Can you just at a high level just talk about the durability of growth that you see in emerging markets? And then, do you think the summation of these emerging markets are starting to get big enough or, perhaps, starting to grow fast enough that it can actually offset some of the China headwinds you're going through?\",\n",
       "    \"We have great results in a number of emerging markets. And as you know, from past calls, I'm particularly keen on India. India set a December quarter record during the quarter. And we're opening more stores there.\",\n",

       "    'Typically, I think it tends to be guided up a little bit, 50 basis points, so sequentially. Can we just touch on what are the offsets of the puts and takes you see here on gross margin?

I was wondering if you could maybe address more broadly channel inventory across your different product lines and regions. Do you feel they are elevated or out of range in any other regions? And given the clearing event that kind of happened in China, I guess, in the quarter, should we think of a more normal progression quarter on quarter into the March quarter in China in particular? And I have a follow-up.',\n",

So, how should investors think about maybe either a top line or margin headwind that, let's say, you're currently absorbing in your results that could potentially maybe reverse in a more balanced regulatory environment? Thank you so much.\",\n",

       "    'Yeah. If you look at Mac, Mac was up 16%. And on iPad, we were up 15%. The Mac was driven by a very strong uptake on our new products during the quarter and the continued success of the MacBook Air.',\n",
       "    \"And so, as you know, we've launched an M4-based MacBook Pro, an iMac, and a Mac Mini during the quarter. We believe we've got the best AI PC out there for running workloads. The silicon in the Mac is, and it has been for several years now, designed by us and really designed for these workloads. And so, I don't want to project at the category level for the future, but we're incredibly pleased with both the Mac and the iPad for the quarter.\",\n",
       "    \"And I'm going to use your earlier discussion about India as a strong emerging market to sort of ask you about the supply chain planning there in terms of how much of the supply chain planning that you're doing is more of a reflection of the growth expectations from that market relative to in terms of more diversification of the supply chain. And how should we sort of think about that strategy related to that particular country? Thank you.\",\n",

       "    'Yeah, if you look at Apple Intelligence, what my point earlier was that markets where we had rolled out Apple Intelligence during the Q1 period performed better on a year-over-year basis than markets where we had not. And so, that gives us a, you know, positive indicator that we were pleased with. There are many compelling reasons to upgrade. And the other thing I would say that I think I mentioned earlier is that if you look at it from a launch to the end of the December quarter, and so, that goes back to September, the 16 family is outperforming the 15 family.',\n",
       "    'And so, I think one is because of the nature of those businesses and in part also because of the way we account for them. And so, one of the big factors that drives the services gross margins are relative performance of those different businesses within the portfolio. We also have the dynamic of some scale businesses like payment services, iCloud that are actually growing. And there, when we add incremental users, those end up being, you know, accretive to margins as well.',\n",
       "    \"And so, in general, what we saw in the December quarter was nice momentum across our entire services business that allows us to deliver, you know, that 75% margin at the services level. And I think our guidance takes into consideration, you know, what we think we're going to land from a company standpoint at 46.5 to 47.5, which, again, we think is a strong guide.\",\n",

The M4-based products are so compelling that it's driving both upgrades at the double-digit level, and it's driving switchers at a double-digit level. And so, we're seeing both come out, and I think it's just because of the compelling products.\",\n",

I'm kind of curious, how much more levels do you have on the product side to improve the gross margin? Or do you think some of the more new AI-related devices, there's more upside to gross margin from here on the product hardware side?\",\n",

One of them is the, you know, various product launches that we have, different products do have different margin profiles. And so, that mix does make a difference. And in particular, what we're seeing is, for example, many of our mixes across like phone, for example, we're seeing customers gravitate toward our pro products, you know, because of things like affordability that allows our customers to get, you know, into our best products, which have, you know, favorable gross margins.\",\n",
       "    \"So, we're continuing to see that trend, you know, the impact of this in the December quarter. As well, I think we're in a favorable commodity environment from a cost standpoint. And so, you know, we're benefiting from that as well in the December quarter. And then, you know, that's going to be, as we talked about, we're going to have a foreign exchange headwind heading into the March quarter.\",\n",
       "    \"But we figured, you know, that's contemplated in the guidance range that we gave in the 46.5% to 47.5%.\",\n",

       "    'Our next question is from Richard Kramer with Arete Research. Please go ahead.',\n",
       "    \"Thanks very much. My first question is for Tim. I'd like to ask about what might accelerate the pace of Apple Intelligence adoption. I guess, do you see this simply as a question of time, i.e., to launch more markets and languages, or increase the percentage of install base devices that can support it? Or is it a question of money, i.e., shifting R&D or marketing spend toward AI.\",\n",
       "    'And based on other prior Apple services, do you expect a sort of tipping point where adoption will go mainstream? Thanks.',\n",
       "    \"OK, thank you. And then, Kevan, one of Luca's legacies was really getting Apple to record margin levels and also maintaining very consistent pricing across the product range. But taking the current high levels of profitability is fairly stable. What observations might you share about price sensitivity of users and whether having a wider range of pricing across the products might unlock potentially further market share gains or boost overall product growth?\",\n",
       "    \"Yeah, it's a good question. I think, you know, one, I don't think we're going to really depart from what served us pretty well to now. I mean, we always take into consideration, you know, looking at short-term, you know, comparisons between short term and the long term. I think we've had a pretty disciplined pricing strategy which would serve us pretty well.\",\n",
       "    \"And I think we're going to, you know, continually kind of stick with that as far as I can tell.\",\n",
       "    'OK. Thanks.',\n",
       "    'Thank you, Richard. Operator, could we get the next question, please?',\n",

       "    \"Great. And, Tim, as a follow-up, there is a lot of discussion on agentic AI, the use of agents. Do you guys see the upgraded Siri expected in April as something that will, let's say, be the killer application among the suite of features that you have announced on Apple Intelligence?\",\n",

Please note that some of the information you'll hear during our discussion today will consist of forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, those regarding revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, other income and expense, taxes, capital allocation, and future business outlook, including the potential impact of macroeconomic conditions on the company's business and results of operations. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results or trends to differ materially from our forecast.

       "    'Thank you, Suhasini. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining the call. Today, Apple is reporting revenue of $94.9 billion, a September quarter record and up 6% from a year ago. iPhone grew in every geographic segment, marking a new September quarter revenue record for the category, and services set an all-time revenue record, up 12% year over year.',\n",

And we continue to be excited by the enthusiasm we're seeing in India, where we set an all-time revenue record. This has been an extraordinary year of innovation at Apple. We brought the revolutionary Apple Vision Pro to customers in February, which brings users tomorrow's technology today.\",\n",
       "    'And in June, we announced Apple Intelligence, a remarkable personal intelligent system that combines the power of generative models with personal context to deliver intelligence that is incredibly useful and relevant. Apple Intelligence marks the beginning of a new chapter for Apple Innovation and redefines privacy and AI by extending our groundbreaking approach to privacy into the cloud with private cloud compute. Earlier this week, we made the first set of Apple Intelligence features available in U.S. English for iPhone, iPad, and Mac users with systemwide writing tools that help you refine your writing, a more natural and conversational Siri, a more intelligent Photos app, including the ability to create movies simply by typing a description, and new ways to prioritize and stay in the moment with notification summaries and priority messages.',\n",
       "    \"And we look forward to additional intelligence features in December with even more powerful writing tools, a new visual intelligence experience that builds on Apple Intelligence and ChatGPT integration as well as localized English in several countries, including the U.K., Australia, and Canada. These features have already been provided to developers, and we're getting great feedback. More features will be rolling out in the coming months as well as support for more languages, and this is just the beginning. Now, I'll turn to our results for the quarter, beginning with iPhone.\",\n",
       "    \"iPhone revenues set a September quarter record of $46.2 billion, up 6% from a year ago with growth in every geographic segment. With the introduction of Apple Intelligence, we're beginning a new era for iPhone. iPhone 16 powered by 18 is equipped with an incredible new 48-megapixel Fusion camera, fantastic photo experiences, and the addition of the action button and camera control. And iPhone 16 Pro is the most advanced iPhone we've ever made, powered by A18 Pro and featuring even larger displays, an industry-leading pro camera system with camera control, and studio-quality mics, all with a huge leap in battery life.\",\n",
       "    \"Turning to Mac. Revenue was $7.7 billion, up 2% from a year ago. Just this week, we brought a new generation of Apple silicon to Mac, M4, M4 Pro, and M4 Max. From blazing-fast performance to Apple's most advanced neural engine yet, our latest chips can easily tackle incredibly complex workflows.\",\n",
       "    \"And they ensure our newest Macs will be the best personal computers for AI the instant they hit stores. With the newest additions to our Mac lineup, customers can choose the Mac that's just right for them. Whether that's iMac, the world's best and most beautiful all-in-one; MacBook Air, the world's most popular laptop now with double the starting memory; MacBook Pro, the best pro notebook anywhere; or the incredible mighty new Mac mini, our first-ever carbon-neutral Mac. iPad revenue was $7 billion, 8% higher year over year.\",\n",
       "    \"iPad is unlike any other product on the market today, and it's become an essential device in homes, schools, and businesses of all sizes. Recently, we were thrilled to introduce the newest iPad mini featuring an ultra-compact design built for Apple Intelligence with support for Apple Pencil Pro. It's been a big year for iPad. iPad Air was popular with students and teachers as they got back to school this year, while creators are pushing the boundaries of what's possible with the M4-powered iPad Pro.\",\n",
       "    \"In Wearables, Home, and Accessories, revenue was $9 billion, down 3% from a year ago. During the quarter, we launched the all-new Apple Watch Series 10, bringing a beautiful new design and new capabilities to the world's most popular watch that make it even more powerful, intelligent, and sophisticated. It's the thinnest Apple Watch yet, making it more comfortable than ever while offering the biggest, most advanced display. watchOS 11 brings some huge new health and fitness insights to users including sleep apnea notifications, which help to alert people with a potentially serious but often undiagnosed condition.\",\n",
       "    \"We're proud of the impact we make through our health innovations on Watch, and I'm grateful for every note I receive about the importance of watching people's lives. With AirPods 4, we've broken new ground in comfort and design with our best-ever open-ear headphones available for the first time with active noise cancellation. And we were especially pleased to unveil revolutionary end-to-end hearing health capabilities for AirPods Pro 2 with hearing protection, hearing test, and hearing aid features. These just became available in a software update this week, and we believe this will make a meaningful difference in our users' lives.\",\n",
       "    \"I've already started getting notes from customers calling the experience life-changing. And Apple Vision Pro continues to deliver special experiences that weren't possible before, including immersive entertainment like the new short film, Submerged, which gives people a view into the unique storytelling power made possible by spatial computing. Vision Pro has more than 2,500 native spatial apps and 1.5 million compatible apps for visionOS 2 as well as applications companies are building to reimagine how they work. Vision Pro continues to inspire awe in its users, and we're just scratching the surface of what's possible.\",\n",
       "    \"And just yesterday, we announced we're bringing Vision Pro to Korea and the UAE. As I mentioned earlier, Services achieved an all-time revenue record of $25 billion, up 12% from a year ago and with all-time revenue records across most of our categories. With Apple TV+, we love celebrating the craft of great storytellers who know how to put on a show. Audiences love to discover new movies like Wolfs, explore acclaimed new series like Disclaimer, and dive back into returning favorites like Slow Horses and Shrinking.\",\n",
       "    \"Apple TV+ productions have become fixtures at award shows earning more than 2,300 nominations and more than 500 wins today. Apple also offers a live sports experience in a league of its own with MLS Season Pass, and subscribers have been cheering on their favorite teams in the MLS Cup Playoffs. This month, we also marked 10 years of Apple Pay. There's always something magical about being able to buy groceries or pay for movie tickets seamlessly with your Apple device.\",\n",
       "    \"Today, users choose Apple Pay for purchases across tens of millions of retailers worldwide. And we're excited to make the Apple Pay experience even better with the option to redeem rewards and access loans from credit cards, debit cards, and other lenders right at checkout. Whenever we celebrate big moments, Apple Stores are the best places to share them with customers. I had an incredible time during launch day in September alongside our team at Apple Fifth Avenue where energy and enthusiasm filled the air.\",\n",
       "    \"And in stores all over the world, customers are eager to get a closer look at our latest innovations. We also opened two new stores during the quarter, and we can't wait to bring four new stores to customers in India. We're passionate about education and believe technology has a vital role to play in both helping teachers to inspire their students and students to learn about the world around them. In honor of World Teachers' Day, Apple was proud to share new resources for teachers to engage their students in ways that aim to make learning easy and fun.\",\n",
       "    \"Additionally, we've expanded our education grant program into 100 new schools and communities helping with everything from access to technology to educator resources to scholarships and financial support. As we near the end of the year, we're proud of the progress we've made in our efforts to be carbon-neutral across our entire footprint by the end of the decade. As I mentioned earlier, we were thrilled to introduce our first-ever carbon-neutral Mac with the latest Mac mini. And in another milestone, customers can choose a carbon-neutral option of any Apple Watch.\",\n",
       "    \"These achievements are amazing for all of us at Apple, and we are determined to reach our 2030 goal. At Apple, across everything we do, we manage for the long term because we're always thinking about what comes next, the next great challenge, the next innovative idea, the next big breakthrough. As we close out the year, we have the best lineup we've ever had going into the holiday season, including Apple Intelligence, which marks the start of a new chapter for our products. This is just the beginning of what we believe generative AI can do, and I couldn't be more excited for what's to come.\",\n",

In his 10 years in the role, Luca has done truly exceptional work in shaping Apple as we know it today.\",\n",
       "    \"He has helped manage Apple for the long term thoughtfully and deliberately. He has helped us enrich the lives of so many around the world, and he has been a leader that people look up to and have learned so much from.

       "    \"Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you, Tim, for the very kind words. Serving as Apple's CFO has been a real privilege and an amazing journey, and I've greatly appreciated the support from our investors and the analyst community over the years. Kevan is exceptional, and I know you will enjoy interacting with him going forward. Let me now turn to the results for the fourth quarter of our fiscal year.\",\n",
       "    'We are very pleased to report a new September quarter revenue record of $94.9 billion, up 6% year over year. We grew in the vast majority of the markets we track and achieved September quarter revenue records in the Americas, Europe, and rest of Asia Pacific. Products revenue was $70 billion, up 4% year over year, driven by growth in iPhone, iPad and Mac. Our installed base of active devices reached an all-time high across all products and geographic segments, thanks to very high levels of customer satisfaction and loyalty, and a large number of customers who are new to our products.',\n",
       "    'Services revenue reached an all-time record of $25 billion, up 12% year over year. We saw broad-based strength around the world, reaching all-time records in both developed and emerging markets with double-digit growth and record results across most services categories. Company gross margin was 46.2%, near the high end of our guidance range. Products gross margin was 36.3%, up 100 basis points sequentially, primarily driven by favorable mix.',\n",
       "    \"Services gross margin was 74%, unchanged from the prior quarter. Operating expenses of $14.3 billion were at the midpoint of the guidance range we provided at the beginning of the quarter and up 6% year over year. During the quarter, we recorded a one-time income tax charge of $10.2 billion, which relates to the impact of the reversal of the European General Court's State Aid decision. When we exclude this one-time charge, net income was $25 billion and diluted earnings per share were $1.64, up 12% year over year and a September quarter record.\",\n",
       "    'Operating cash flow was very strong at $26.8 billion, a new September quarter record. Let me now get into more detail for each of our revenue categories. iPhone revenue was $46.2 billion, up 6% year over year and a September quarter record in total and across several markets, including the U.S., the Middle East, Korea, and South Asia. The iPhone active installed base grew to a new all-time high in total and in every geographic segment.',\n",
       "    'During the September quarter, many iPhone models were among the top-selling smartphones around the world. In fact, according to a survey from Kantar, iPhone was the top-selling model in the U.S., urban China, the U.K., Australia, and Japan. We continue to see high levels of customer satisfaction for the iPhone 15 family with 451 Research recently measuring it at 98% in the U.S. Mac revenue was $7.7 billion, up 2% year over year, driven by the strength in MacBook Air.',\n",
       "    'Customers have been loving the performance of Apple silicon on Mac, and we are very excited to bring the latest M4 family of chips to the lineup. The Mac installed base reached an all-time high with about half of customers in the quarter being new to Mac. And in the latest reports from 451 Research, customer satisfaction was 95% in the U.S. iPad generated $7 billion in revenue, up 8% year over year.',\n",

And the latest reports from 451 Research indicated customer satisfaction of 96% for Watch in the U.S. Our Services revenue reached an all-time record of $25 billion, growing 12% year over year. Services continued to see strong momentum with the growth of our installed base of active devices setting a solid foundation for the future expansion of our ecosystem.',\n",
       "    'And we see increased customer engagement with our Services offerings. Both transacting accounts and paid accounts reached a new all-time high with paid accounts growing double digits year over year. Paid subscriptions also grew double digits. We have well over 1 billion paid subscriptions across the services on our platform, more than double the number we had only four years ago.',\n",
       "    'And as always, we remain focused on improving the breadth and quality of our services from new games on Apple Arcade to new features like Tap to Cash and pay with installments using Apple Pay to many successful new and returning shows on Apple TV+.

Power for the fourth year in a row.',\n",
       "    'Turning to enterprise. We continue to see strong demand across our products and services. NVIDIA launched its Mac as a choice program supported by AppleCare for Enterprise and Apple Professional Services with over 10,000 Macs deployed worldwide. And Novartis, a leading global pharmaceutical company, recently chose iPhone 16 as the standard mobile device for all employees.',\n",

       "    \"I was wondering if you could just expand a little bit on some of the early feedback to Apple Intelligence, both for iOS 18.1 but also the developer beta so far, and whether you would attribute Apple Intelligence to any of the strong iPhone performance that we've seen to date. Thanks.\",\n",
       "    'Thanks, Michael. As I noted in my comments, just this week on Monday, we made the first set of Apple Intelligence features available in U.S. English for iPhone, iPad, and Mac. And this includes things like systemwide writing tools that help you refine your writing, a more natural conversational Siri, more intelligent Photos app, including the ability to create movies simply by typing a description, which is really cool, and new ways to prioritize and stay in the moment with notification summaries and priority messages.',\n",
       "    \"There's also email summaries and email priority. We're getting a lot of positive feedback from developers and customers. And in fact, if you just look at the first three days, which is all we have obviously from Monday, the 18.1 adoption is twice as fast as the 17.1 adoption was in the year-ago quarter. And so, there's definitely interest out there for Apple Intelligence.\",\n",
       "    \"Great. Thank you very much. And my second one, just for Luca. First, congratulations again, Luca, on the new role, and it's been a real privilege of being able to spend some time with you.\",\n",
       "    'A question that, I think, will overlap with your new role as well. Could you just talk a little bit about the capex outlook and whether investments in things like private cloud compute could change the historical capex range of roughly $10 billion a year? Thank you very much.',\n",
       "    'Thank you, Michael. On the capex front, I mentioned before a number of times, we have a bit of a hybrid model in the way we run our data centers. In some cases, we use our own data centers. In some cases, we use third-party providers.',\n",
       "    \"So, our capex numbers may not be fully comparable with others. But obviously, we are rolling out these features, Apple Intelligence features already now. And so, we are making all the capacity that is needed available for these features. You will see in our 10-K the amount of capex that we've incurred during the course of fiscal '24.\",\n",
       "    'Great. Thank you, Tim. Thank you, Luca.',\n",
       "    'All right. Thanks, Mike. Can we have the next question, please?',\n",
       "    'Our next question is from Erik Woodring with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.',\n",
       "    \"Great. Thanks so much for taking my questions. I have two as well. Tim, maybe if we start with you, I think each of the last four years, you've exited the December quarter with iPhone demand outpacing supply.\",\n",
       "    \"As we look to this quarter in the iPhone 16 cycle, lead times are relatively short. There are no known supply shortages. And I'm just curious whether you've been able to maybe get a better read on early cycle iPhone demand this year relative to past years and if so, what you've learned about upgrade rates, switching rates, trade-ups versus trading down, and being more price sensitive. And overall, any impact that Apple Intelligence may have on iPhone 16 sales? And then I have a follow-up.\",\n",
       "    'Thank you.',\n",
       "    \"And so, if you look at how we've done this year, we did that very quickly on the 16, on the 16 Pro family, the Pro and the Pro Max. We've been constrained in October, but we believe that soon we'll be out of constraint. And so, that's a good sign from our point of view. Keep in mind that that's a function of supply and demand, not one side or the other.\",\n",
       "    \"And we've been preparing for the quarter for a while. So, that's what I would say there.\",\n",
       "    \"OK. That's really helpful. Thank you, Tim. And then, Luca, if I just turn to you, obviously, it's been a pleasure working with you, and we wish you all the best in the next role.\",\n",
       "    \"There's plenty of debate in the market right now about input cost and commodity prices and the impact that will have on gross margins. Historically, you do guide gross margins up 50 basis points sequentially, which you just told us about for the December quarter. So, can you maybe just help us understand your view of component prices and broadly whether you still see those as tailwinds to gross margins and how sustainable that tailwind might be or whether that should become a headwind as we look forward? Thanks so much.\",\n",
       "    \"Yes, Erik. As you know, our gross margins are a factor of many, many variables. Commodities, of course, are important. They're not the only factor.\",\n",

We have well over 1 billion paid subscriptions on our platform right now between our own services and third-party services.\",\n",

And if I can just follow up, if I look at the growth rates across the different geographies, there's always concern around China when it comes to iPhone demand, I feel, but the performance in September looks fairly good. Just wondering if you could just touch on what are you seeing from a demand perspective in China if the recent stimulus plans in China could essentially be a catalyst for iPhones. And then EMEA really stood out with double-digit growth.\",\n",

       "    \"Yeah. I'll take the China question. If you look at how we did for the quarter, we were relatively flat year over year.

When you think about, to Luca's point, about the rollout being staged over the next several quarters across the world, do you think that has any impact on sort of the normal historical demand cadence across different regions? So, should we see something different, let's say, in the December quarter, the March quarter, or the June quarter, etc., relative to history given the timing of the rollout and where customers are probably waiting for the devices to be enabled to have the operating system? Would just love to kind of get your perspective on how we think about the demand cadence, how it might be different than maybe historically.\",\n",

We set all-time revenue records in a number of markets, including Canada, Indonesia, Mexico, Spain, Turkey, and Vietnam, along with quarterly records in Brazil and India.\",\n",
       "    \"As a result of a challenging environment, our revenue was down 5% year over year. But I'm proud of the way we have navigated circumstances, seen and unforeseen, over the past several years, and I remain incredibly confident in our team and our mission and in the work we do every day. Let me discuss the three factors that impacted our revenue performance during the quarter. The first was foreign exchange headwinds, which had a nearly 800 basis point impact.\",\n",
       "    'On a constant currency basis, we grew year over year and would have grown in the vast majority of the markets we track. The second factor, which we described in a November 6th update with COVID-19-related challenges, which significantly impacted the supply of iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max and lasted through most of December. Because of these constraints, we had significantly less iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max supply than we planned, causing ship times to extend far beyond what we had anticipated. As we always have, every step of the way throughout the pandemic, we continue to prioritize people and worked with our suppliers to ensure the health and safety of every worker.',\n",
       "    'Production is now back where we want it to be. The third factor was a challenging macroeconomic environment as the world continues to face unprecedented circumstances from inflation, to war in Eastern Europe, to the enduring impacts of the pandemic. And we know that Apple is not immune to it. But whatever conditions we face, our approach is always the same.',\n",

It's a wonderful thing to be a part of, and it's so rewarding for all of us at Apple when we hear how much our customers are loving what we create. Let me talk now about what we saw across our product categories. Starting with iPhone.\",\n",
       "    'Revenue came in at $65.8 billion for the quarter, down 8% year over year. However, on a constant currency basis, iPhone revenue was roughly flat. Our customers continue to rave about the astounding camera capabilities and unprecedented battery life and the groundbreaking suite of health and safety features. The iPhone 14 lineup pushes the limits of what users can do with a smartphone.',\n",
       "    'During the quarter, Mac revenue came in at $7.7 billion, which was in line with what we had expected. We had a difficult compare because this time last year, we had the extremely successful launch of the redesigned M1 MacBook Pros. We also faced a challenging macroeconomic environment and foreign exchange headwinds. We remain confident in and focused on the long-term opportunity for Mac.',\n",
       "    'Just last month, we introduced new MacBook Pro models powered by our latest developments in Apple silicon, M2 Pro, and M2 Max. These chips enable unprecedented performance and do so with less energy, which is not only good for the environment but gives the newest MacBook Pro the longest battery life ever in a Mac. We also introduced the M2-powered Mac mini, which will supercharge productivity for users of all kinds and leave them stunned by just how powerful a Mac mini can be. During the quarter, iPad revenue grew 30% to a total of $9.4 billion.',\n",
       "    \"The very strong growth was due in part to a favorable compare to the December quarter a year ago when we experienced significant supply constraints. Customers continue to praise our new lineup for its versatility, whether it's the new iPad Pro now powered by the M2 or the newly designed iPad 10th Generation with its stunning liquid retina display and beautiful colors. Revenue for Wearables, Home and Accessories was $13.5 billion, which was down 8% year over year driven by foreign exchange headwinds and a challenging macroeconomic environment. We remain excited about the long-term opportunity in the category.\",\n",
       "    \"As an example, a few weeks ago, we announced the next-generation HomePod, which is an indispensable addition to the smart home. This powerful smart speaker relies on advanced computational audio to produce an incredible listening experience. We're also helping users make their homes safer with sound recognition.

We're also a year closer to 2030, and we were ever focused on the environmental commitments we set out for the end of the decade.

       "    'Thank you, Tim, and good afternoon, everyone. As Tim mentioned, revenue for the December quarter was $117.2 billion, down 5% from last year. A number of factors had a significant impact on our results. First, we faced a very difficult foreign exchange environment, which affected our performance by nearly 800 basis points.',\n",
       "    'In other words, we grew revenue on a constant currency basis. And in fact, we did so in the vast majority of markets.

Third, we experienced significant supply shortages for iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max in November and through December.',\n",
       "    \"On the other hand, we had the positive impact of the 14th week in the quarter that Tejas just mentioned at the beginning of the call. Products revenue was $96.4 billion, down 8% from last year due to the factors I just called out. At the same time, however, our installed base of active devices grew double digits and achieved all-time records in each geographic segment and in each major product category. We're proud to now have over 2 billion active devices in our installed base.\",\n",
       "    'This continued growth in the installed base is due to extremely strong levels of customer satisfaction and loyalty and a high number of customers who are new to our products. The installed base growth also helped our services set an all-time revenue record of $20.8 billion, up 6% a year ago. We achieved this new milestone despite more than 700 basis points of negative impact from foreign exchange. We reached all-time services revenue records in the Americas, Europe, and rest of Asia Pacific and a December quarter record in Greater China.',\n",
       "    'We also set records in many services categories, including all-time revenue records for cloud services, payment services and music and December quarter records for the App Store and AppleCare. Company gross margin was 43%, up 70 basis points from last quarter due to leverage and favorable mix, partially offset by foreign exchange. Products gross margin was 37%, up 240 basis points sequentially. And services gross margin was 70.8%, up 30 basis points sequentially, both due to the same factors that impacted total company gross margin.',\n",
       "    'Operating expenses of $14.3 billion were significantly below the guidance range we provided at the beginning of the quarter and grew at a slower pace than in the past as we took actions to respond to the current macro environment. Net income was $30 billion. Diluted earnings per share were $1.88, and we generated very strong operating cash flow of $34 billion. Let me now get into more detail for each of our revenue categories.',\n",
       "    'iPhone revenue was $65.8 billion despite significant foreign exchange headwinds, supply constraints on iPhone 4 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max, and a challenging macroeconomic environment. In spite of these circumstances, we set all-time iPhone revenue records in Canada, Italy, and Spain, and saw strong growth in several emerging markets, including all-time iPhone revenue records for India and Vietnam. Importantly, this installed base of active iPhones continues to grow nicely and is at an all-time high across all geographic segments. In emerging markets, in particular, the installed base grew double digits.',\n",
       "    'And we had record levels of switchers in India and in Mexico. Our customers continue to love their experience with our products, with the latest survey of U.S. consumers from 451 Research indicating customer satisfaction of 98% for the iPhone 14 family. Mac revenue was $7.7 billion, down 29% year over year and in line with our expectations.',\n",
       "    \"There were three key drivers for our Mac results. First, we had a challenging compare against last year's launch of the completely reimagined MacBook Pros, our first notebooks with M1 Pro and M1 Max. Second, we believe that the macro environment impacted our Mac performance. And third, we faced significant foreign exchange headwinds.\",\n",
       "    'At the same time, however, the installed base of active Macs reached an all-time high across all geographic segments, and we continue to see very strong upgraded activity to Apple silicon. Customer satisfaction with Mac remains very strong at 96% based on the latest survey of U.S. consumers from 451 Research. iPad revenue was $9.4 billion, up 30% year over year despite significant FX headwinds.',\n",
       "    'This performance was driven by two key items. First, during the December quarter a year ago, we experienced significant supply constraints, while this year, we had enough supply to meet demand. Second, we launched our new iPad and the iPad Pro powered by the M2 chip during the quarter. The iPad installed base reached a new all-time high, thanks to incredible customer loyalty and a high number of new customers.',\n",
       "    'In fact, over half of the customers who purchased iPads during the quarter were new to the product. Wearables, Home and Accessories revenue was $13.5 billion, down 8% year over year. The year-over-year decline was driven by significant FX headwinds and a challenging macroeconomic environment. However, our installed base of devices in the category set a new all-time record, thanks to the largest number of customers new to a smartwatch that we ever had in a given quarter.',\n",
       "    'In fact, nearly two-thirds of customers purchasing an Apple Watch during the quarter were new to the product. Moving to services. We generated $20.8 billion in revenue, a new all-time record in total, and for many services offerings in spite of a difficult foreign exchange environment, and macroeconomic headwinds impacting certain categories such as digital advertising and mobile gaming. In constant currency, we grew services revenue double digits on top of growing 24% during the December quarter a year ago.',\n",
       "    'We remain focused on the large long-term opportunity in this category, and we continue to observe several trends that reflect the strength of our ecosystem. For example, we saw increased customer engagement with our services during the quarter. Both our transacting accounts and paid accounts grew double digits year over year, each setting a new all-time record. Paid subscriptions also continued to grow nicely.',\n",
       "    'We now have more than 935 million paid subscriptions across the services on our platform, up more than 150 million during the last 12 months alone and nearly four times what we had just five years ago. And we continue to increase the reach and improve the quality of our offerings. For instance, Apple Pay is now available to millions of merchants in nearly 70 countries and regions. And we saw a record-breaking number of purchases made using Apple Pay globally during the holiday shopping season.',\n",
       "    'Finally, our installed base of over 2 billion active devices represents a great foundation for future expansion of our ecosystem, and it continues to grow even during difficult macroeconomic conditions, which speaks to the exceptionally high levels of customer loyalty and satisfaction and our ability to attract new customers to our platform. The growth is coming from every major product category and geographic segment, with strong double-digit increases in emerging markets such as Brazil, Mexico, India, Indonesia, Thailand, and Vietnam. Turning to the enterprise market. we are seeing continued adoption of our services for business like Apple Business Essentials, AppleCare, Tap to Pay, and Apple Financial Services.',\n",
       "    'For example, Mars Incorporated has expanded its use of AppleCare for Enterprise to provide timely device support and assurance for iPads deployed across their manufacturing sites. Meanwhile, HCA Healthcare has leveraged Apple Financial Services to manage the annual refresh of its entire fleet of iPhones. This not only ensures that their staff stay current on the latest Apple technology, but also provides them with significant annual savings in the process. Let me now turn to our capital return program and our cash position.',\n",
       "    'We returned over $25 billion to shareholders during the December quarter as our business continues to generate very strong cash flow. This included $3.8 billion in dividends and equivalents and $19 billion through open market repurchases of 133 million Apple shares. We ended the quarter with $165 billion in cash and marketable securities. We repaid $1.4 billion in maturing debt and decreased commercial paper by $8.2 billion, leaving us with total debt of $111 billion.',\n",
       "    \"As a result, net cash was $54 billion at the end of the quarter, and we maintain our goal of becoming net cash-neutral over time. As we move into the March quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Tejas referred to at the beginning of the call. Given the continued uncertainty around the world in the near term, we are not providing revenue guidance, but we are sharing some directional insights based on the assumption that the macroeconomic outlook and COVID-related impacts to our business do not worsen from what we are projecting today for the current quarter. In total, we expect our March quarter year-over-year revenue performance to be similar to the December quarter.\",\n",
       "    'This represents an acceleration in our underlying year-over-year business performance as the December quarter benefited from an extra week. Foreign exchange will continue to be a headwind, and we expect a negative year-over-year impact of five percentage points. For services, we expect revenue to grow year over year while continuing to face macroeconomic headwinds in areas such as digital advertising and mobile gaming. For iPhone, we expect our March quarter year-over-year revenue performance to accelerate relative to the December quarter year-over-year revenue performance.',\n",
       "    'For Mac and iPad, we expect revenue for both product categories to decline double digits year over year because of challenging compares and macroeconomic headwinds. We expect gross margin to be between 43.5% and 44.5%. We expect opex to be between $13.7 billion and $13.9 billion. We expect OI&E to be around negative $100 million, excluding any potential impact from the mark-to-market of minority investments, and our tax rate to be around 16%.',\n",
       "    \"Finally, today, our board of directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.23 per share of common stock payable on February 16, 2023, to shareholders of record as of February 13, 2023. With that, let's open the call to questions.\",\n",
       "    'Thank you, Luca. [Operator instructions] Operator, may we have the first question, please?',\n",
       "    'Questions & Answers:',\n",
       "    'Certainly. We will go ahead and take our first question from David Vogt with UBS.',\n",
       "    \"Thanks, guys, for taking my question. So Tim, and maybe this is for Luca as well. You talked about the supply chain returning back to normal after a very difficult October, November, but we're still seeing some disruptions across tech products, whether it's enterprise or consumer-facing. How do you think about your supply chain and maybe the levels of inventory or builds that you might need as we go forward to sort of insulate your business from these sort of episodic disruptions? Have you changed your view? And if so, how does that affect ultimately margins and sort of your balance sheet and cash flow items going forward? Thanks.\",\n",
       "    \"This is Tim, David. From a supply point of view, we did see disruption from early November through most of December. And from a supply chain point of view, we're now at a point where production is what we need it to be. And so the problem is behind us.\",\n",
       "    \"In terms of going forward in the supply chain, we build our products everywhere. There are component parts coming from many different countries in the world, and the final assembly coming from three countries in the world on just iPhone. And so we continue to optimize it. We'll continue to optimize it over time and change it to continue to improve.\",\n",
       "    'Great. Thank you.',\n",
       "    'Great. Thanks. Can we have the next question, please?',\n",
       "    'Our next question is from Shannon Cross of Credit Suisse.',\n",
       "    \"Thank you very much. Luca, I wanted to dig a bit more into the commentary on gross margin. The guidance especially of 43.5% to 44.5% is obviously quite strong. So I'm wondering what's helping you out there, assume mix and some other things.\",\n",
       "    'And then how should we think about what currency and hedge is going to do as we look forward? And then I have a follow-up.',\n",
       "    \"Shannon, yes, I mean, we've had good margin for the December quarter to start with. We reported 43%. Obviously, in December, we have the benefit of leverage because of the seasonality of the business, but we also had favorable mix across the board. Of course, foreign exchange is an issue right now.\",\n",
       "    \"In the December quarter on a sequential basis, foreign exchange was a negative 110 basis points for us. And on a year-over-year basis, it's 300 basis points. So obviously, the FX environment has changed a lot during the last 12 months. For March, yes, we've seen a margin expansion, 43.5% to 44.5%.\",\n",
       "    \"We're doing a lot of work around cost, of course. Mix will continue to help, both within categories and services mix as we move away from the holiday season. But we're doing a lot of work on the cost structure, and that is paying off. Foreign exchange is still a negative, about 50 basis points sequentially, but it's mitigating.\",\n",
       "    'The last couple of weeks, the dollar has weakened a bit. And so hopefully, as we go through the year, hopefully, things will improve. But for now, as you correctly state, we are in a good position on margins.',\n",
       "    'Thank you.',\n",
       "    'Great. Thanks, Shannon. Can we have the next question, please?',\n",
       "    'Our next question is from Erik Woodring of Morgan Stanley.',\n",
       "    'Yes. The installed base is now over 2 billion active devices, as you mentioned. And we set records across each geographic segment and major product category. And so it was a broad-based change.',\n",
       "    \"Two, correct one thing you said, it's up over 150 million year over year. The last report we reported to be over 1.85. And so it's 150 million, which we're very proud of. We also saw strong double-digit in several of the emerging markets, which is very important to us.\",\n",
       "    'For example, India and Brazil as just two examples. So very, very strong. And obviously, it bodes well for the future.',\n",
       "    \"Great. Thank you for that, Tim. And then, Luca, obviously, the December quarter was negatively impacted by the production challenges. Can you just maybe unpackage where channel inventory levels are today kind of across the iPhone broadly? And then what the data that you're seeing so far this quarter is telling you about iPhone demand deferral versus kind of iPhone demand structuring and perhaps pushing some upgrades later into the year rather than into the March quarter? And that's it for me.\",\n",
       "    \"Yes. Erik, I'll take that one as well. The channel inventory levels on iPhone, we obviously ended the December quarter below our target range given the supply challenges on iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max. But as you think about this, keep in mind that a year ago, we also exited the December quarter below our target inventory range because of supply challenges in the year-ago quarter.\",\n",
       "    \"Yeah. That's great. Thanks so much.\",\n",
       "    'Thanks, Erik. Can we have the next question, please?',\n",
       "    'Our next question comes from Aaron Rakers of Wells Fargo. Yeah. Thanks for taking the question.',\n",
       "    'Yeah. Thanks for taking the question. I have two as well, if I can. I guess the first kind of question, just going back on the gross margin line.',\n",
       "    \"Pretty good guidance into this March quarter. I'm curious if you unpack that a little bit specific around what you're seeing as far as may be benefits from component pricing in the guidance, if you're embedding any of that at this point.\",\n",
       "    \"Yes. Of course, with our guidance, we try to capture every aspect of our cost structure. And obviously, components are a big portion of that. So definitely, that's included.\",\n",
       "    'And so obviously, components are a big part of that.',\n",
       "    \"Yep. It is a major focus of ours. It's incredible in terms of how it can enrich customers' lives. And you can look no further than some of the things that we announced in the fall with crash detection and fall detection or back a ways with ECG.\",\n",
       "    \"I mean these things have literally save people's lives. And so we see an enormous potential in this space to affect virtually everything we do. It's obviously a horizontal technology, not a vertical. And so it will affect every product in every service that we have.\",\n",
       "    'Thanks. Can we have the next question, please?',\n",
       "    'Our next question comes from Amit Daryanani of Evercore.',\n",
       "    \"Yep. Thanks for taking my question. I guess the first one I have is, Tim, I think based on your earlier comments that iPhones would have grown ex the production issue that implied that maybe it's a $7 billion or so impact that you had in December quarter from the production challenges on the high-end models. I'm sure it's tough to see what happens this time around.\",\n",
       "    \"But I think historically, when you've had production issues or things like this happen, what has the consumer behavior being typically? Do they tend to go down toward the lower-end models and get the phone they want quickly? Or do they just defer the production? Just from a historical perspective, I think do you typically recover what's deferred out or no?\",\n",
       "    \"It's very hard to estimate is the real answer because you have to know a lot of data, and it's usually only in hindsight that you have a more reasonable view of it. And so we put our best views in the color that Luca provided. That's kind of what I would say.\",\n",
       "    \"All right. And then I guess maybe if I think about services as you go forward. I know you had really good growth in services, I think, over the last several years. But as you go forward in services, what do you think drives the growth more? So is it the expansion of your installed base? Or is it more going to be driven by ARPU going higher for you? I'm just curious, how do you think about those two buckets as you go forward?\",\n",
       "    \"Amit, there's a number of things, and I've mentioned a few of them during the call. The first step is always the installed base. It's the engine for services growth. And the fact that the installed base is growing very nicely, and it's growing in a lot of emerging markets, it's growing even faster, that gives us a larger addressable pool of customers.\",\n",
       "    \"And we have a lot of transacting accounts that kind of moved to paid accounts over time. The other aspect that is very important for us is to continue constantly to improve the reach and the quality of our services. And I give the example of Apple Pay, which it's a great example because we started off primarily in the United States. Now we've taken it to 70 markets, millions of merchants.\",\n",
       "    'OK. Thank you.',\n",
       "    'Thanks, Amit. Can we have the next question, please?',\n",
       "    'Our next question comes from Harsh Kumar of Piper Sandler.',\n",
       "    \"Yeah. Hey. Tim,I had a quick question on emerging markets. Seems like you're making a lot of strides in India.\",\n",
       "    \"Potentially wanted to understand the kind of share you have in China and India. And relative to that, what would be your aspirational but sort of achievable share in iPhones in those territories, whether it's units or revenues? And I was hoping to draw on your experience and maybe what you've seen in other countries where you've had some longer presence.\",\n",
       "    \"We will soon bring Apple retail there. So we're putting a lot of emphasis on the market. There's been a lot done from a financing options and trade-ins to make products more affordable and give people more options to buy. And so there's a lot going on there.\",\n",
       "    'OK. Fair enough. Thank you, Tim.',\n",

       "    'Thanks. Can we have the next question, please?',\n",
       "    'Our next question comes from Wamsi Mohan of Bank of America.',\n",
       "    \"Thank you. Tim, you've done a phenomenal job of driving consumer choice toward higher-end products within your portfolio. How would you compare this cycle for iPhones if you were to segment the Pro versus non-Pro models versus the cycles from the past few years? And do you think this move to higher ASPs is sustainable? Or do you think it reverses in a tighter consumer spending environment? And I have a follow-up.\",\n",
       "    \"And we feel very good about the product that we announced back in September and are happy to now be at a point where we're shipping to the demand.\",\n",
       "    \"And Tim, do you think that this move to sort of higher ASPs that has happened over the last few years is sustainable? Or could it sustain in this very tough macro environment that you've cited?\",\n",
       "    'OK. Great. And Tim, you clearly emphasize the focus and importance of the installed base. If we think about the absolute grit of the installed base from 1 billion to 2 billion over 7 years from a device standpoint, how should we think about the penetration of services or the growth in paying customers on services or that time frame? Is that penetration rate increasing or decreasing? How fast is that growing relative to the growth of the overall installed base?',\n",
       "    \"Wamsi, it's Luca. Yes, of course, we keep track of that. It's really important for us. Over the last seven years, as we doubled the installed base, we've seen a growing engagement of our customers on the platform.\",\n",
       "    \"That happens, first of all, by customers transacting on the platform and then moving to paid accounts. So starting to pay for some of the services. That percentage of paid accounts tends to grow over time. We've seen it in developed markets.\",\n",
       "    \"We see it in emerging markets. And that is due to some of the reasons that I was explaining earlier, including the fact that we made it easier for our customers to get engaged on the platform. For example, we offer multiple payment methods in many countries. And we've made it easier to explore for more services because we've added a lot of services on the platform over the last seven years.\",\n",
       "    'So to your question, of course, higher engagement means a higher percentage of paid accounts over time.',\n",
       "    'OK. Thank you.',\n",
       "    'All right. Thanks, Wamsi. Can we have the next question, please?',\n",
       "    'Our next question comes from Richard Kramer of Arete Research LLP.',\n",
       "    'Operator, can we move on to the next?',\n",
       "    \"Richard? OK. Next we'll hear from Jim Suva of Citigroup. Jim, your line is open. If you can release your mute function, we are unable to hear you.\",\n",
       "    \"Tim and Luca, you both mentioned earlier on the Q&A a little bit about India. I was wondering if we're now entering a situation of even more opportunity because we've exited COVID. We've exited countries with different COVID criteria. We've also seen India build out its higher-speed transmissions.\",\n",
       "    \"Yes. Jim, we actually did fairly well through COVID in India. And I'm even more bullish now on the other side of it, or hopefully, on the other side of it. And that's the reason why we're investing there.\",\n",
       "    \"We're bringing retail there and bringing the online store there and putting a significant amount of energy there. I'm very bullish on India.\",\n",
       "    'Thank you. And then as my quick follow-up, you had mentioned that Services, not necessarily specific to India, but Services overall were better than expected. And of course, supply chain was more challenged than expected. So what was the bridge factor of services being better than expected on upside? Was it like advertising or apps or paid monthly subscriptions? Or what were kind of the things that really surprised you to the upside on services? Thank you.',\n",
       "    'So we had a number of categories that set new records, all-time records. And they did a bit better than we were expecting at the beginning of the quarter. And so Tim mentioned that during, I think, his prepared remarks that when you look at it in constant currency, we grew services double digits. And that was on top of a 24% increase a year ago.',\n",
       "    \"So it's very sustained growth that we're seeing.\",\n",

And where are you seeing the least impact from the softening macro? And then I had a quick follow-up.',\n",
       "    'We think there were some impact across the products and in Services. Probably, the ones that we saw the most impact on were Mac and Wearables. You can see that in those numbers. And probably, the least would have been iPhone.',\n",

Over the past year, despite a range of challenges facing the world, our teams have come together in incredible ways to drive unparalleled innovation and deliver again and again for our customers.For the September quarter, we reported record revenue of $90.1 billion, which was better than we anticipated despite stronger-than-expected foreign currency headwinds.

We are very pleased to report record financial results for the September quarter that capped another record fiscal year for Apple despite a challenging and volatile macroeconomic backdrop. We reached a September quarter revenue record of $90.1 billion, up 8% year over year despite over 600 basis points of negative foreign exchange impact, with new September quarter records in the Americas, Europe, Greater China, and rest of Asia Pacific. Importantly, in constant currency, we grew nicely in each of our geographic segments, with strong double-digit growth outside the U.S.',\n",
       "    'Products revenue was $71 billion, up 9% over last year despite FX headwinds and a record for the September quarter. And it was a September quarter revenue record for iPhone and wearables, home and accessories and an all-time revenue record for Mac. Overall, our installed base of active devices continue to grow nicely. It reached an all-time high for all major product categories and geographic segments at the end of the quarter, thanks to extremely strong customer satisfaction and loyalty and a high number of customers that are new to our products.',\n",
       "    'Our Services set a September quarter revenue record of $19.2 billion, up 5% over a year ago despite over 600 basis points of negative impact from foreign exchange. We reached September quarter revenue records in the Americas, Europe, Greater China and rest of Asia Pacific and also in many services categories, including all-time revenue records for cloud services and payment services. Company gross margin was a September quarter record at 42.3%. It was down 100 basis points from last quarter due to unfavorable foreign exchange and a different mix, partially offset by leverage.',\n",
       "    'Products gross margin was 34.6%, up 10 basis points sequentially, with improved leverage and favorable mix partially offset by foreign exchange. Services gross margin was 70.5%, down 100 basis points sequentially, primarily due to foreign exchange. Net income of $20.7 billion, diluted earnings per share of $1.29 and operating cash flow of $24.1 billion were all September quarter records. Let me now get into more detail for each of our revenue categories.',\n",
       "    'iPhone revenue grew 10% year over year to a September quarter record of $42.6 billion, despite significant foreign exchange headwinds. We set September quarter records in the vast majority of markets we track, and our performance was particularly impressive in several large emerging markets, with India setting a new all-time revenue record and Thailand, Vietnam, Indonesia, and Mexico more than doubling year over year. Thanks to our strong iPhone lineup, we set a quarterly record for upgraders and grew switchers double digits. This level of sales performance, along with unmatched customer loyalty, drove the active installed base of iPhones to a new all-time high across all geographic segments.',\n",
       "    'And the latest survey of U.S. consumers from 451 Research indicates iPhone customer satisfaction of 98%. It was a great quarter for Mac. We achieved an all-time revenue record of $11.5 billion, up 25% year-over-year, despite significant FX headwinds.',\n",
       "    'There were three key items that helped drive this performance. First, we benefited from the launch of our new MacBook Air and MacBook Pro powered by the M2 chip. Second, we were able to satisfy pent-up demand that carried forward from the significant supply constraints we faced during the June quarter. Third, as our supply position improved, we were able to fill the channel.',\n",
       "    'Importantly, our investment in the category has attracted both upgraders and customers new to Mac and helped our installed base reach an all-time high. In fact, we set a quarterly record for upgraders, while nearly half of customers buying Macs during the quarter were new to the device. iPad revenue was $7.2 billion, down 13% year over year due to significant negative foreign exchange and a challenging compare due to the launch of new iPads a year ago. Despite this, the iPad installed base reached a new all-time high, thanks to incredible customer loyalty and a high number of new customers.',\n",
       "    'In fact, over half of the customers who purchased iPads during the quarter were new to the product. Wearables, home and accessories revenue was $9.7 billion, growing 10% year over year, driven by the launch of Apple Watch and new AirPods Pro. This level of safe performance along with very strong new tool rates, drove our installed base of devices in the category to a new all-time record. For instance, two-thirds of customers purchasing an Apple Watch during the quarter were new to the product.',\n",
       "    \"Moving to Services, as I mentioned, we set a September quarter record in aggregate and in most geographic segments, generating $19.2 billion in revenue in spite of very large foreign exchange headwinds. It is important to remember, that we achieved double-digit constant currency growth in services on top of growing 26% during the September quarter a year ago. However, certain services were impacted by macroeconomic headwinds, including foreign exchange. Digital advertising and gaming are areas where we've seen some softness.\",\n",
       "    'Throughout the quarter, we continued to observe several trends that reflect the strength of our ecosystem and our long-term opportunity in the category. First, our continued installed base growth across each geographic segment and each major product category represents a great foundation for future expansion of our ecosystem. Second, we saw increased customer engagement with our services during the quarter. Both our transacting accounts and paid accounts grew double digits year over year, each setting a new all-time record.',\n",
       "    'The percentage of accounts that pay for our services continues to increase, and we still see plenty of opportunity ahead of us. Third, paid subscriptions showed very strong growth. We now have more than 900 million paid subscriptions across the services on our platform, up more than 155 million during the last 12 months alone and double what we had just three years ago. We continue investing in new content and features, across our service offerings.',\n",
       "    \"For example, we added several popular sports titles to Apple Arcade. We're also excited about our global partnership with Major League Soccer, where starting next season, fans can stream every single MLS match through the Apple TV app. This momentum helped us achieve over $78 billion in services revenue during fiscal 2022, a new record and up 14% year over year. We continue to invest confidently and believe strongly in the long-term potential of our services business, which is already the size of a Fortune 50 business on its own, and has nearly doubled during the last four years.\",\n",
       "    'It was not only a record year for services but also for our entire company. During the past four quarters, we grew our business by 8% or $29 billion, reaching more than $394 billion of revenue. We grew diluted earnings per share by 9% and generated over $111 billion of free cash flow, up 20% year over year. It was also a strong year for our enterprise business, as we set new annual records for iPhone, iPad and Mac during fiscal 2022 and grew strong double-digits year over year as our devices and services continue to help more and more companies empower their employees and serve their customers.',\n",
       "    \"For instance, Ford Manufacturing employees are using iPad and iPhone to help further improve the quality of its game-changing Ford F-150 Lightning electric trucks. iPhone's powerful A-series chip and advanced camera systems, along with third-party iOS apps, are enabling Ford to automate the visual quality inspection process in real-time to help address issues before they impact customers. And Cisco expanded its Macs as a choice program and is now offering it to all its employees to help attract and retain top talent. And when given this choice, employees have chosen Macs twice as often as other options.\",\n",
       "    'In addition, many enterprise customers are taking advantage of the high residual value of our products and simple trade-in process to standardize the refresh cycles for their fleets of Apple devices. This allows employees to upgrade to the latest devices regularly while making it highly predictable and cost effective for the business. Let me now turn to our cash position. Our business continues to generate very strong cash flow, which enabled us to return over $29 billion to shareholders during the September quarter.',\n",
       "    'This included $3.7 billion in dividends and equivalents and $25.2 billion through open market repurchases of 160 million Apple shares. We ended the quarter with $169 billion in cash and marketable securities. We repaid $2.8 billion in maturing debt and decreased commercial paper by $1 billion while issuing $5.5 billion of new debt, leaving us with total debt of $120 billion. As a result, net cash was $49 billion at the end of the quarter as we continue to make progress toward our goal of becoming net cash neutral over time.',\n",
       "    \"As we move ahead into the December quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Tejas referred to at the beginning of the call. Given the continued uncertainty around the world in the near term, we are not providing revenue guidance but we are sharing some directional insights based on the assumption that the macroeconomic outlook and COVID-related impacts to our business do not worsen from what we are projecting today for the current quarter. Overall, we believe total company year-over-year revenue performance will decelerate during the December quarter as compared to the September quarter for a number of reasons. First, we expect nearly 10 percentage points of negative year-over-year impact from foreign exchange.\",\n",
       "    'Second, on Mac, in addition to increasing FX headwinds, we have a very challenging compare against last year, which had the benefit of the launch and associated channel fill of our newly redesigned MacBook Pro with M1. Therefore, we expect Mac revenue to decline substantially year over year during the December quarter. Specifically on services, we expect to grow but to be impacted by the macroeconomic environment increasingly affecting foreign exchange, digital advertising and gaming. We expect gross margin to be between 42.5% and 43.5%.',\n",
       "    \"We expect opex to be between $14.7 billion and $14.9 billion. We expect OI&E to be around negative $300 million, excluding any potential impact from the mark-to-market of minority investments and our tax rate to be around 16.5%. Finally, today, our board of directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.23 per share of common stock, payable on November 10, 2022, to shareholders of record as of November 7, 2022. With that, let's open the call to questions.\",\n",

       "    'Questions & Answers:',\n",
       "    \"We'll go ahead and take our first question from Shannon Cross calling from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\",\n",
       "    \"Thank you very much. It's great to talk to you on the call again. I'm wondering, can you just talk a bit about how you're thinking about this iPhone generation? On the positive side, you've raised prices. It seems to be mixing up.\",\n",
       "    \"On the negative side, investors are concerned about impacted demand from the higher prices, what Huawei meant to you in prior years versus what could happen now. There are just some pressures out there. So I'm curious if you can talk to what you're seeing initially in iPhone demand and how you think it will move through. With the caveat that I understand, things are pretty uncertain out there.\",\n",
       "    'And then I have a follow-up. Thank you.',\n",
       "    \"Shannon, it's Tim. Welcome back. iPhone grew 10% in the Q4 timeframe to $42.6 billion. Customer demand was strong and better than we anticipated that it would be.\",\n",
       "    \"And keep in mind that this is on top of a fiscal year of 2021 that had iPhone revenue grow by 39%, and so it's a tough compare as well. And so we were happy with it. In terms of the new products, the 14 and the 14 Pro and Pro Max, it's still very early. But since the beginning, we've been constrained on the 14 Pro and the 14 Pro Max and we continue to be constrained today.\",\n",
       "    \"And so we're working very hard to fulfill the demand. It's difficult to say what the mix will be until we can satisfy the demand because we're not able to determine the accurate mix until then. But we're working very hard to do that. We were really pleased with the broadness of the iPhone strength last quarter.\",\n",
       "    'We had three of the top four smartphones in the U.S. and the U.K., the top three in Urban China, the top six in Australia, four out of the top five in Germany and the top two in Japan. And customer satisfaction for the iPhone remains very, very strong at 98%. And so we feel very good about how we performed in Q4.',\n",
       "    \"And certainly, the start of this generation would suggest that we're going to be constrained for a little while on the 14 Pro and 14 Pro Max. But we're working very hard to try to remedy that.\",\n",
       "    \"Yeah. Well, let me start with gross margin in Q4 and then I'll get to Q1. It was a September quarter record for the company. We did 42.3%, and that is in spite of, as you mentioned, very significant negative FX, for example, for Q4, on a sequential basis, FX was negative 70 basis points and on a year-over-year basis it was negative 170 basis points.\",\n",
       "    \"Essentially every currency around the world has weakened against the dollar. Now, we have guided Q1 to 42.5% to 43.5% in spite of the fact that we have, on a year-over-year basis, 330 basis points of negative exchange. Sequentially, it's 120 basis points unfavorable. So obviously, the strong dollar makes it difficult in a number of areas.\",\n",
       "    \"Obviously, our pricing in emerging markets makes it difficult, and the translation of that revenue back into dollars is affected. But on the positive side, we are seeing commodities behave fairly favorably for us. And so we believe we can offset the negative foreign exchange that we're seeing. And I think that the guidance that we provided reflects that.\",\n",
       "    'It takes into account, of course, FX. It takes into account some level of inflationary pressures. But I think the outcome is, I think, is a good one.',\n",
       "    'Great. Thank you very much.',\n",
       "    'Thanks, Shannon. Can we have the next question, please?',\n",
       "    'Our next question is coming from Erik Woodring with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead, sir.',\n",
       "    'Hey, guys. Thanks very much for taking my questions. I have two as well. Maybe if we could just start.',\n",
       "    \"Yeah, Erik, it's Tim. I'll take your question. If you look at the Mac, the Mac, it was the best quarter we've ever had in the history of the company. It was helped by the product launch of the MacBook Air with M2.\",\n",
       "    'It was helped that in the previous quarter, in the June quarter, if you remember, we lost output from the factory for a significant portion of the quarter. And so we had a backlog exiting our Q3 headed into Q4. We were able to satisfy all of that demand during Q4 and filled the channel for the Mac. And so that led to an incredible Mac quarter.',\n",
       "    'If you look at iPad, iPad had sort of the opposite happening from a launch point of view. The comp from a year ago, we launched iPads in September. We launched iPads this year in October. The other point to remember is that the iPad Pro had just launched before the quarter started in the year-ago quarter so it was our first full quarter of iPad Pro.',\n",
       "    \"So it was an exceptionally strong iPad quarter a year ago, and the launches were really key to that performance. And so that's the reason iPad contracted during this quarter.\",\n",
       "    \"OK.That's helpful. Thank you, Tim. And then maybe, Luca, if I were just to ask you, obviously, Tejas at the beginning of the call talked about the 14-week quarter. Maybe can you just elaborate a little bit on how you think that 14-week quarter impacts different line items, whether it's products or certain segments within the product business or the services stand-alone? Just where we should see that 14-week quarter provide a bit more of a tailwind versus maybe not have an impact at all? And that's it for me.\",\n",
       "    'Thanks.',\n",
       "    \"So that's what happens to us every approximately six years as we need to align our weekly calendar to the fiscal calendar.\",\n",

       "    \"Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for taking the question. Tim, I was hoping we could talk a little bit about services, pieces within the portfolio. It looks like there's been some price adjustments as of late with respect to Music, TV Plus and the One bundle.\",\n",
       "    \"I'm curious how you think about balancing the consumer price versus your own costs and kind of the associated follow-through. And then I have a follow-up.\",\n",
       "    \"Yes. If you look at the price increase that you referenced, Ben, on Monday of this week, we announced a price increase on Apple Music and on Apple TV Plus and then the corresponding Apple One, that is the consolidated bundle that includes both of those. There's really two different situations here. With Music, the cost of licensing increased.\",\n",
       "    \"And so we are paying more for music. The good thing about that is the artist will also get more money for their songs that are enjoyed on streaming. And so there's some bit of good news there, I suppose. And then on Apple TV Plus, if you look at when we first priced it, we only had a very few shows.\",\n",
       "    \"We were at the beginning. We are very focused on originals only, and so we had four or five shows or so in the beginning and priced it quite low. We now have a lot more content and are coming out with more each and every month. And so, we've increased the price to represent the value of the service.\",\n",
       "    'And of course, Apple One is just the consolidation of those two price changes.',\n",
       "    'OK. And then, another item. Any preliminary thoughts around capital intensity into fiscal 2023? Last couple of years, capex has been relatively stable. Can you talk to the big constituents of the capex figure and maybe any moving pieces and how we could think about that to 2023? Thank you.',\n",
       "    \"Yes, Ben. So when we look at our capex, as you correctly said, I mean, we've been fairly stable, and I think our capital intensity is really very good. We have three major buckets in capex for the company. We have certain dedicated tools for the manufacturing facilities.\",\n",
       "    'We had some spend around data centers, and we have spent around our office facilities around the world. We obviously monitor all of them. There is nothing unusual that we see for the next 12 months.',\n",
       "    'OK. Thanks, guys.',\n",

       "    'Our next question is coming from Kyle McNealy calling from Jefferies. Please go ahead.',\n",
       "    \"Hi. Thanks very much. Just wanted to see if you could give us a sense for what drove the Wearables result and the strength there this quarter. Was it from the maybe strong iPhone attach rates or the new products that you have available that were announced this quarter, or maybe you're still getting some benefit from customers that are more willing to come into the store now and try things on versus the pandemic when that was kind of shut down?\",\n",
       "    \"Yes. Kyle, it's Tim. If you look at Wearables, we grew 10%, which we were very happy with. If you look at the individual pieces of that, Apple Watch was a contributor.\",\n",
       "    \"And the reviews for the product have just been off the charts in terms of the noise cancellation features and the sound quality. We're getting great, great reviews from there. In terms of what played the other way, the headwinds, obviously, FX was a headwind that affected wearables, home, and accessories, just like it affected the rest of our products and services. And we also had effect from the business in Russia, obviously, or the impact there.\",\n",
       "    \"So that's sort of the pro and the con. The other thing that I should mention is that about two-thirds of the Apple Watches that we sold were to customers that had not previously owned an Apple Watch. And so we're still very much selling to new customers here, which is very, very good for the future.\",\n",
       "    'OK. Great. One more quick one on Mac. I wanted to see if you could quantify at all how much the channel fill and how much came from satisfying back orders from the June period for Mac.',\n",
       "    \"We're just trying to get a sense for where the baseline is, if there's any sense you can give us on that. What would it have grown if not for those factors? Anything you can give us would be great. Thanks.\",\n",
       "    'Yes. I would just say that all three of the reasons that I gave were key in achieving the 25%. The M2 MacBook Air, the launch of the new product, satisfying the back orders from the previous quarter and then filling the channel, all of those were key contributors.',\n",

       "    \"Jim, it's Luca. No. You're right. Obviously, the FX impact on our business depends on the geographic mix of the sales that we do.\",\n",
       "    \"Of course, you know that part, and gaming on the App Store was affected. But we were very happy with what we saw in terms of the behavior of our customers with the engagement with services. And I mentioned a number of things during the prepared remarks, the fact that, obviously, that installed base is growing, that's a positive and it's a great foundation for the future. We are seeing more transacting accounts and more paid accounts, they're both growing double digits.\",\n",

       "    'The next question is coming from Amit Daryanani from Evercore. Please go ahead.',\n",
       "    \"Thanks for taking my question. I have two as well. The first one really is around the iPhone trajectory. There's been a fair amount of focus in terms of what's going to happen to iPhone demand, given the macro worries.\",\n",
       "    \"It would be really helpful to understand though, given the strength you're seeing, where do you think channel inventory is for iPhones today versus where it would be from a historical perspective? And do you see the channel getting to an optimal level by end of December quarter? Because evenly right now given the lead time data, it looks like your revenue trajectory in iPhones is more driven by the supply you have versus demand. So any color on the channel inventory would be helpful.\",\n",
       "    'Got it. And then I guess, Tim, you folks have been talking about digital advertising a fair bit over the last few quarters, I think. Is there any metrics, any vectors you can talk about kind of to give us a sense of how big those businesses or what vectors are you focused on? And really, if you could talk about, do you think Apple can build an advertising business at scale without sacrificing consumer privacy?',\n",
       "    \"So first and foremost, we focus on privacy and so we would not do anything that stepped away from that. We feel that privacy is a basic fundamental human right, and so that's sort of the lens that we look at it under. Our specific advertising business is not large and relative to others and so forth. But we don't release the exact numbers on it, but it's clearly not large.\",\n",
       "    'Thanks, Amit. Can we have the next question, please?',\n",
       "    \"We'll now move on to Mr. Harsh Kumar calling from Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.\",\n",
       "    \"Yeah. Hey, thanks guys, First of all, fellows congratulations on stellar performance. There's a lot of large-cap companies that are getting ripped around, so we appreciate the steady cadence here. Tim, I wanted to ask you about inflation pressures and labor problems here in the U.S.\",\n",
       "    \"I'll let Luca talk about FX. In terms of the people piece, we're focused on taking care of our teams and offering them the best benefits and best compensation so that we can empower them to do the best work of their lives. And so that's what we're focused on in terms of our teams. In terms of inflation, there's clearly wage inflation.\",\n",
       "    \"And we've obviously taken that into consideration in the gross margin guidance that Luca gave earlier in the call.\",\n",
       "    \"Yes. And on foreign exchange, you're right. I mean, it's obviously a very significant factor that is affecting our results, both revenue and gross margin. What do we do about situation like this, one where we have a very strong dollar? Of course, we hedge our exposures.\",\n",
       "    \"We try to hedge them in as many places as possible around the world. For example, I think we've been probably the first company that started hedging our exposure in China several years ago. There may be a few currency, small ones, where we don't hedge because the cost is prohibitive or the market is not there. But in general, we tend to hedge because it gives us significant level of margin stability.\",\n",
       "    \"customers have seen. And that's unfortunately the situation that we're in right now with the strong dollar. So that's the way we try to deal with that. I have to say that one of the things that we've really appreciated the most during the quarter was the fact that in spite of this very strong dollar and the difficult FX environment, we have seen very strong performance in many international markets, particularly some very large emerging markets where even in reported currencies, so in U.S.\",\n",
       "    \"dollars, we're seeing very strong double-digit growth in places like India, Indonesia, Mexico, Vietnam, many places where we've done incredibly well. And obviously, in local currency, those growth rates are even higher. It's important for us to look at how these markets perform in local currency because it really gives us a good sense for the customer response to our products, the engagement with our ecosystem and in general, the strength of the brand. And I have to say, in that respect, we feel very, very good about the progress that we're making in a lot of markets around the world.\",\n",
       "    'Thanks, Tim and Luca. I had a follow-up. Luca, in your prepared remarks for the guidance, you mentioned that for the December quarter, you expect the performance to decelerate relative to September. So September was a year-over-year about, call it, 8%.',\n",
       "    \"What we said is that we're going to be decelerating from September, so September was 8%, so it's going to be a lower percentage than 8%. We're not providing guidance for the reasons that we've explained. There's a lot of uncertainty there. And so we see how the quarter progresses.\",\n",
       "    \"Keep in mind the 10 points of exchange. Certainly, in normal times, we will be talking about very different numbers, but that's where we are right now.\",\n",

       "    'Yeah. Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I had two of them.',\n",
       "    \"First one, either for Tim or Luca, on cash and capital allocation. Given there's some correction and valuation for some of the private and public companies, does it change your thought process on the time line to get to cash-neutral? In other words, would you be more aggressive with acquisitions, or you think holding on to more cash due to interest income becomes more attractive versus your prior investment goals? And then I had a quick follow-up.\",\n",
       "    \"This is Tim. In terms of acquisitions, we averaged about one per month, I believe, in across fiscal year 2022. And so we're constantly looking in the market. And what's out there.\",\n",
       "    \"And what things would be synergistic. And which things would provide either intellectual property or talent or preferably both that we would need. And so we're constantly looking at acquisitions of all sizes.\",\n",
       "    \"In terms of cash deployment, obviously, we like to look at the capital return program over the long arc of time. And we have done, since the beginning of the program we've done over $550 billion of buyback at an average repurchase price of $47. So the program has been incredibly successful. We are still in a position where we have net cash.\",\n",
       "    \"And we said all along, we want to get to cash-neutral at some point. Our cash generation has been very, very strong over the years, particularly last year. I think I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we did $111 billion of free cash flow. That's up 20% year over year.\",\n",
       "    'And so we will put that capital to use for investors.',\n",
       "    \"Got it. Very helpful, Tim and Luca. And then a quick follow-up for Luca on the December guidance, thanks for the color on that. I'm just kind of curious, the extra week in the quarter, is that not helping offset some of the FX, or in other words, the 10 percentage point negative impact from FX will be much higher if that's a 13-week quarter?\",\n",
       "    \"No. I wouldn't say that because those are percentages. So yeah, no, the 10 points wouldn't be different. 13 or 14 weeks would be the same.\",\n",

Today, Apple is reporting another record June quarter with revenue of $83 billion, which was better than we expected despite supply constraints, strong foreign exchange headwinds, and the impact of our business in Russia. We set June quarter records in the Americas, in Europe, and in the rest of Asia Pacific region.',\n",
       "    'We also saw June quarter revenue records in both developed and emerging markets with very strong double-digit growth in Brazil, Indonesia, and Vietnam and a near doubling of revenue in India. We saw great enthusiasm for our products and services, resulting in an all-time record for our installed base of active devices. Our supply constraints were less than we anticipated at the beginning of the quarter, coming in slightly below the range we discussed during our last call. We know that this is a time of significant challenge around the world for all of us confronting new variants of COVID-19, to those experiencing a prolonged humanitarian crisis in Ukraine and everyone dealing with the consequences of an uncertain economic environment.',\n",
       "    'We know that much of the world is living through uneasy times, and it is all the more reason why we are working hard to help our customers navigate the world as it is while empowering them to create the world as it can be. Turning to iPhone. We set a June quarter record for both revenue and switchers to iPhone. With its advanced performance, capability and ease of use, customers continue to find that iPhone remains the gold standard for smartphones.',\n",
       "    \"And they've been raving about the iPhone 13 lineup's extraordinary camera quality with features like cinematic mode and macro photography to create eye-catching content. We were also proud to celebrate the 15th anniversary of iPhone, a device that continues to change the world in profound ways with each new innovation. Last month, Apple unleashed a wave of innovation, including the completely redesigned MacBook Air and a new 13-inch MacBook Pro. Both of these systems are powered by M2, our next generation of Apple silicon for Mac.\",\n",
       "    \"M2 delivers a faster CPU, GPU, and neural engine along with higher memory bandwidth and new capabilities like Pro Res acceleration. And it continues the tremendous pace of innovation in Apple silicon for the Mac. We continue to have supply constraints with Mac, but we're encouraged by the strong response from customers to our incredible lineup. iPad, like Mac, continued to see strong demand during the June quarter despite ongoing supply constraints.\",\n",
       "    \"Customers and developers have been especially excited about the new features we're bringing to iPad with iPadOS 16. This update was one of the many announcements we made at a truly extraordinary WWDC, where we shared a range of new features that give customers more control of their experience than ever before. This includes the ability to edit or delete sent messages, a new way of organizing apps on iPad and Mac, and an all-new customizable lock screen on iPhone and so much more. Today, iOS 16, iPadOS 16, MacOS Ventura, and watchOS 9 are all in public beta, and we couldn't be more excited to see what our community of developers creates with them.\",\n",
       "    \"We unveiled new innovations and accessibility such as door detection and live captions that support users with disabilities with navigation, health, communication, and more. We also announced Apple Pay Later, which gives customers more flexibility to make purchases with their Apple devices. And with our next generation of CarPlay, we're improving the driving experience with deeper integration into vehicle hardware, allowing drivers to control their music, change the temperature and monitor their fuel levels, all from a single integrated platform. In the Wearables, Home, and Accessories category, the innovation infused across our products continues to win over new customers.\",\n",

Services revenue rose to $19.6 billion, a June quarter record and a 12% increase year over year, which was in line with our expectations. We're proud of how Apple TV+ productions like Severance and Black Bird have captured the popular imagination, and we're looking forward to more exceptional content developed by extraordinary creators throughout the year. In two and a half years since launch, Apple TV+ has now earned 250 wins and over 1,100 award nominations and counting.\",\n",
       "    'Just this month, we learned that Apple TV+ earned 52 Emmy Award nominations across 13 titles. In our last call, I mentioned Friday Night Baseball on Apple TV+, which is already delighting baseball fans.

One of the best parts of WWDC was welcoming developers to Apple Park while continuing to connect with developers all over the world.',\n",
       "    \"This year, we had an incredible group of developers and more opportunities to learn from one another than ever before. It was a truly special experience and a reminder of the economic miracle the App Store represents. We are proud of the fact that the iOS app economy supports more than 2.2 million jobs here in the United States and many more around the world. It's been wonderful to see earnings by small developers more than double over the past two years.\",\n",

In 2021, we prevented nearly $1.5 billion in fraudulent transactions by stopping over 1.6 million risky and vulnerable apps and app updates. Now I want to turn to retail. This quarter, we opened the doors to Apple's first store in the Hubei province in China, welcoming the community to a beautiful new space.\",\n",

We also celebrated the graduation of the inaugural class of our Developer Academy in Detroit from a program designed to give students the skills they need to pursue jobs in the thriving iOS app economy.

       "    'Thank you, Tim, and good afternoon, everyone. We are very pleased to report June quarter financial results that continue to demonstrate our ability to innovate across hardware, software, and services while operating our business effectively during very challenging economic circumstances. We set a June quarter revenue record of $83 billion, up 2% year over year despite supply constraints, over 300 basis points of foreign exchange headwinds and the impact of our business in Russia. Around the world, we set new June quarter records in the Americas, in Europe, and rest of Asia Pacific.',\n",
       "    'On the product side, revenue was $63.4 billion with a June quarter revenue record for iPhone. During the quarter, our installed base of active devices continue to grow well, thanks to our unmatched levels of customer satisfaction and loyalty and reached an all-time high for all major product categories and geographic segments. Our Services set a June quarter revenue record of $19.6 billion, up 12% over a year ago, with all-time revenue records in the Americas and the rest of Asia Pacific and June quarter records in Europe and Greater China. We also achieved June quarter revenue records in each major Services category, including all-time revenue records for Music, Cloud Services, Apple Care, and Payment Services.',\n",
       "    'Company gross margin was 43.3%, down 40 basis points from last quarter as seasonal loss of leverage and unfavorable foreign exchange were partially offset by favorable mix. Products gross margin was 34.5%, down 190 basis points sequentially, mainly driven by seasonal loss of leverage, mix, and FX. Services gross margin was 71.5%, down 110 basis points sequentially due to a different mix and foreign exchange. Net income was $19.4 billion and diluted earnings per share were $1.20, while operating cash flow of $22.9 billion was a June quarter record.',\n",
       "    'Let me now get into more detail for each of our revenue categories. iPhone revenue grew 3% year over year to a June quarter record of $40.7 billion despite foreign exchange headwinds as customer response to our iPhone 13 family continue to be strong. We set June quarter records in both developed and emerging markets. And the iPhone active installed base reached a new all-time high across all geographies as a result of this level of sales performance combined with unmatched customer loyalty.',\n",
       "    'In fact, the latest survey of U.S. consumers from 451 Research indicates iPhone customer satisfaction of 98%. We also attracted a record number of switchers for the June quarter, with strong double-digit year-over-year growth. For Mac, we generated revenue of $7.4 billion despite supply constraints and negative effects.',\n",
       "    'We continue to be excited about our long-term opportunity with Mac and redefining the PC experience with our relentless innovation. Our investment focus on Mac has helped drive significant growth in our installed base, which reached an all-time high during the June quarter as nearly half of the customers purchasing a Mac were new to the product. iPad revenue was $7.2 billion, down 2% year over year due to supply constraints and negative foreign exchange. Customer response to our iPad lineup continue to be strong across consumer, education, and enterprise markets around the world.',\n",
       "    'And the iPad installed base reached a new all-time high, with over half of the customers during the quarter being new to the product. Wearables, Home, and Accessories revenue was $8.1 billion, down 8% year over year as we faced foreign exchange headwinds, different launch timing for Home and Accessories products and supply constraints as well as the overall macroeconomic environment. Despite this, our installed base of devices in the category hit a new all-time record, thanks to very strong customer loyalty and high new tool rates. For example, Apple Watch continues to extend its reach, with over two-thirds of customers purchasing an Apple Watch during the quarter being new to the product.',\n",
       "    'Services had a June quarter revenue record of $19.6 billion, up 12% despite almost 500 basis points of FX headwinds as well as impacts from our business in Russia and the macroeconomic environment. We set June quarter revenue records in both developed and emerging markets and set all-time records in many countries around the world, including the U.S., Mexico, Brazil, Korea, and India. The record level of performance of our services portfolio during the June quarter reflects the strength of our ecosystem on many fronts: First, our installed base has continued to grow, reaching an all-time high across each geographic segment and major product category. We also saw increased customer engagement with our Services during the quarter.',\n",
       "    'Our transacting accounts, paid accounts, and accounts with paid subscriptions all grew double digits year over year. And paid subscriptions showed very strong growth. We now have more than 860 million paid subscriptions across the services on our platform, which is up more than 160 million during the last 12 months alone. And finally, we continue to improve the breadth and the quality of our current Services offerings, from a constant flow of new content on Apple TV+ and Apple Arcade to great new features we recently announced for iCloud and Apple Music, which we believe our customers will love.',\n",
       "    'In the enterprise market, our customers are increasingly investing in Apple products as a strategy to attract and retain talent. Bank of America is providing iPhones to all of its financial advisors so they can instantly access client information and provide timely wealth management advice from anywhere. Wipro, another large global enterprise customer, is investing in MacBook Air with M1 as a competitive advantage when recruiting new graduates globally, thanks to its superior performance and lower total cost of ownership. And with the new M2 chip powering MacBook Air and the 13-inch MacBook Pro, we expect more customers to make Mac available to their entire workforce.',\n",
       "    'Let me now turn to our cash position. We ended the quarter with $179 billion in cash and marketable securities. We repaid $3 billion in maturing debt while increasing commercial paper by $4 billion, leaving us with total debt of $120 billion. As a result, net cash was nearly $60 billion at the end of the quarter.',\n",

This included $3.8 billion in dividends and equivalents and $21.7 billion through open market repurchases of 143 million Apple shares. We continue to believe there is great value in our stock and maintain our target of reaching a net cash neutral position over time. As we move ahead into the September quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Tejas referred to at the beginning of the call.\",\n",
       "    'Given the continued uncertainty around the world in the near term, we are not providing revenue guidance but we are sharing some directional insights based on the assumption that the macroeconomic outlook and COVID-related impacts to our business do not worsen from what we are projecting today for the current quarter. Overall, we believe our year-over-year revenue growth will accelerate during the September quarter compared to the June quarter despite approximately 600 basis points of negative year-over-year impact from foreign exchange. On the product side, we expect supply constraints to be lower than what we experienced during the June quarter. Specifically related to services, we expect revenue to grow but decelerate from the June quarter due to macroeconomic factors and foreign exchange.',\n",
       "    'We expect gross margin to be between 41.5% and 42.5%. We expect opex to be between $12.9 billion and $13.1 billion. We expect OI&E to be around negative [Inaudible] impact from the mark-to-market of minority investments and our tax rate to be around 16%. Finally, today, our board of directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.23 per share of common stock, payable on August 11, 2022, to shareholders of record as of August 8, 2022.',\n",

       "    \"We'll take our first question from Amit Daryanani with Evercore.\",\n",
       "    'I guess two from my side. Maybe to start on the gross margin discussion, Luca. You said that implying gross margin will be down I think, 130, 140 basis points sequentially and down a bit year over year as well in September. Maybe just what other puts and takes are in.',\n",
       "    'And then very specifically, can you actually just call it what the FX headwinds are embedded in the September quarter gross margin, that would be helpful.',\n",
       "    \"Yes, Amit. We're guiding 41.5% to 42.5%. On a sequential basis, the decline is expected to be driven by, as you mentioned, foreign exchange but also mix, which will be partially offset by better leverage. We expect foreign exchange impact on a sequential basis to be 50 basis points.\",\n",
       "    \"If you look at it from a year-over-year standpoint, we are in the ballpark of a year ago in spite of the fact that foreign exchange is going to be 130 basis points negative to a year ago. So clearly, foreign exchange is something that is affecting us but we think we're navigating that fairly well.\",\n",
       "    \"Fair enough. And then if I could just ask Tim the question. There's a lot of macro worries and high inflation impacting consumer demand. Certainly doesn't seem to be very visible in your performance and your expectations.\",\n",
       "    \"So I'm wondering if you talk about, are you seeing any implications from recession fears or inflation fears to your end demand? And really just related to that, variables decline was notable. Is that where you would typically see initial signs of consumer softening perhaps?\",\n",
       "    \"When you look at the product categories, on iPhone, there was no obvious evidence of macroeconomic impact during the June quarter besides FX, obviously. Mac and iPad were so gated by supply that we didn't have enough product to test the demand. And Wearables, Home, and Accessories, as you mentioned and as Luca mentioned, we did see some impact there that we would attribute to a macroeconomic environment. When you then look at Services, there were some Services that were impacted, for example, like digital advertising was clearly impacted by the macroeconomic environment.\",\n",
       "    \"And so it's a mixed bag in terms of what we believe that we saw. Overall, we are very happy with the results. And when you think about the number of challenges in the quarter, we feel really good about the growth that we put up for the quarter.\",\n",
       "    \"We'll take our next question from Harsh Kumar with Piper Sandler.\",\n",
       "    'Yes. First of all, congratulations. As these are tough times, you guys are putting up tremendous results so we appreciate that as investors. My question is, when I look at your services business, I see a $20 billion business on a quarterly basis.',\n",
       "    \"Well, as you know, we don't provide guidance past the current quarter. But I think the way to think about it, certainly the way we think about it is that there's a number of levers in our services business to take into account. The first one is installed base. Installed base is the engine for our company and it continues to grow.\",\n",
       "    \"As I mentioned, it has reached an all-time high across every geographic segment, across every product category. And so that's very important. Then the second lever is the customer engagement. And we know that our customers are getting more and more engaged over time.\",\n",
       "    \"Transacting accounts, paid accounts, paid subscriptions are growing, so the level of engagement continues to grow. And then as you mentioned, the breadth and the quality of the services that we offer tends to grow over time. So these are all things that tend to help us over the long term. If you go back and you look at our growth rates over a number of quarters now, they've always been very good.\",\n",
       "    \"Of course, the macro environment can have an impact on this business. Tim has mentioned, for example, digital advertising can be affected at times. During COVID, some of the compares have been a bit lumpy because there have been lockdowns and reopenings and so on. So it's very difficult to talk about a steady-state growth rate for our services business.\",\n",
       "    'But when we look at the entirety of what we are doing in the Services space, we feel very good about the future of the business.',\n",
       "    'Luca, very helpful. And for my follow-up, valuations have come down in the last 18 months or so for things and companies and targets that you might look at. I guess, particularly in the services area, would there be an appetite on behalf of Apple to accelerate the growth of its Services business by looking at external products to acquire?',\n",
       "    \"We'll take our next question from Erik Woodring with Morgan Stanley.\",\n",
       "    \"I have two as well. Maybe Tim, if I start with you, I think there's a debate in the market that if you look back over time, there's been a three-year cadence to iPhone cycles. We're two years into your 5G iPhone evolution. You're on track to grow units in '21 and '22.\",\n",
       "    \"That implies there could be some pressure next year as upgrade rates slow. But your comments really suggest no slowdown. You're seeing double-digit growth in customers new to iPhone. So can you just walk us through some of the various factors you believe are driving this continued iPhone strength? And then I have a follow-up.\",\n",
       "    'Today, the product and the innovation within the product that is driving it. And of course, the other key variables are some things that Luca mentioned earlier where the size of the installed base has been growing significantly. We also, just in this quarter, the June quarter, set a June quarter record for switchers with strong double-digit growth. And so this is fueling the additional installed base even more.',\n",
       "    \"And we continue to execute across some significant geographies where there's a very low penetration of iPhone. Some of those were called out in the opening remarks between Indonesia and Vietnam and India, where we did quite well, and iPhone tends to be the engine for those markets, particularly at the beginning of creating the market there for Apple products. And so we're really looking at all of these things from the installed base to the number of switchers to the geographic distribution. Of course, the most important thing for us is to maintain an incredible customer satisfaction and loyalty from the customers.\",\n",
       "    \"And we're really pleased that it's currently at 98% for the latest iPhones. And so those are the things that underpin it. 5G has been an accelerant. And the 5G penetration, particularly if you look at it globally, is still quite low.\",\n",
       "    \"In some geographies, it's obviously higher, but around the world, 5G penetration is still low. And so I think there's reason to be optimistic.\",\n",
       "    \"OK, that's helpful. And then maybe, Luca, for you. As we move from the June to the September quarter, maybe can you dig a level deeper and kind of help us understand some of the moving pieces in the services business? Meaning where do you think we could see an acceleration or maybe a deceleration? And should we still expect double-digit growth? If you could just frame that for us, that would be great.\",\n",
       "    \"Yes, Erik. I mentioned in my prepared remarks that we expect some deceleration from the 12% that we've had in the June quarter. Keep in mind, we're going to see, on a year-over-year basis, 600 basis points, 6% impact from foreign exchange so that is a big element for us. Also keep in mind that we're still lapping the impact of our business in Russia in these numbers.\",\n",
       "    \"And Tim mentioned that there are some pockets of weakness, primarily in digital advertising that we will need to work through. But at the same time, our Services business a year ago grew a lot and so also the compare is a bit challenging. So we don't have a very specific number to give out today. Of course, we expect to grow.\",\n",
       "    'We will see how the quarter develops.',\n",
       "    \"We'll take our next question from Richard Kramer with Arete Research.\",\n",
       "    \"Tim, you cited growth in Apple apps in the past, and clearly, the privacy policies you've taken have really reshaped the mobile ad market. Can you give us a sense of how you see Apple's role as an ad network and perhaps helping developers to monetize not just app sales but also growing ad monetization over time?\",\n",
       "    'Yes. Richard, we view privacy as a fundamental human right. And so what we try to do with all of our features on privacy is put the decision back at the user where we believe it belongs as to whether they want to share their data or not. And so that was what was behind application tracking transparency and a number of other features.',\n",
       "    \"We're trying to empower the user to own their data and make their own choices. In terms of us selling ads, we have a search ad business across the App Store that we believe represents a great way for discovery for small and large developers. And so I see that we play a role in that.\",\n",
       "    \"Yes. I mean, obviously, affordability is a very important topic for us. It's been for many years. Buy now, pay later is the latest that we are doing on this front.\",\n",
       "    'Fundamentally, we are working on two major initiatives for affordability. One is installment plans and installment plans have become more widespread around the world, not only here in the United States but in most markets, particularly in emerging markets. Incredibly important in terms of reducing the affordability threshold. And trading programs.',\n",
       "    \"Trading programs are available in a number of markets. We can do better in other markets. They're incredibly important because the residual value of our products is a huge differentiator for our users. After they use our devices, they can bring them back and they retain much more value than other platforms.\",\n",
       "    \"And therefore, it's important for us to raise that awareness. And so we will continue to expand those programs around the world. So installments and trade-ins, very, very important on affordability.\",\n",
       "    \"We'll take our next question from David Vogt with UBS.\",\n",
       "    \"I just wanted to circle back on sort of the macro and sort of the demand signals that you're seeing versus sort of the supply chains that you're facing. I know that there's been a couple of U.S. carriers that have talked about some of their customers having some difficulty paying bills. And you mentioned in your prepared remarks that you saw sort of the record number of switchers in the quarter.\",\n",
       "    \"So just wanted to kind of get a sense for what you're seeing in that particular channel without naming a specific customer. And are you seeing any sort of issues from a spin-down effect maybe because customers are having some difficulty because of inflation? And then I have a follow-up on Macs.\",\n",
       "    \"Do you still feel that way? And if you can kind of share how you're thinking about the different sort of components of your growth versus the market.\",\n",
       "    \"We felt good, frankly, that we were able to, by the end of the quarter, get this back to where we were down 10 points. But the negative 10 I would classify as being driven by supply. And of course, FX feeds into this as well because of the translation issues around the world. There's also some impact because of the business in Russia.\",\n",
       "    \"But those are the three kind of reasons that I would tell you. In terms of testing the demand, you can't really test the demand unless you have the supply. And we were so far from that last quarter that we have an estimate of what we believe demand was. But it is an estimate.\",\n",
       "    \"We recognize how the industry is doing. We think that we've got a great story with the Mac with getting M1 out and now M2 out. We have a very, very strong offering for the back-to-school season and we'll see how we do this quarter. We'll report back in October.\",\n",
       "    \"We'll take our next question from Ben Bollin with Cleveland Research.\",\n",
       "    \"Tim, I was hoping you could share a little bit more about how you're thinking about the supply headwinds. You said less severe or less worse supply challenges into September. I'm interested when you think you find balance across products. And also, any thoughts on how or when that might influence replenishment of supply into your retail channels?\",\n",
       "    \"To give you a little more color on what we saw in the June quarter, we came in slightly below, from a constraint point of view, the $4 billion number that we had put, at the four to eight are the low end of that range. And the majority of that constraint last quarter was coming out of the COVID restrictions that occurred, that resulted in plant closures and plants running at less than full utilization for some amount of the quarter, in some cases, the majority of the quarter. And then the other component that is the minority part of it is the silicon shortage that has affected our results for several quarters now. If you look into the future, the silicon shortage, we're not forecasting when that will end.\",\n",
       "    \"OK. The other item. Tim, any thoughts on how you're thinking strategy is evolving with respect to progress in AR, VR in your existing products? Anything you're learning about content or how you're thinking about that opportunity?\",\n",
       "    \"We're thrilled right now to have over 14,000 ARKit apps in the App Store. And they're providing incredible AR experiences for millions of people. And that's utilizing iPhone and iPad. And of course, we are in the business of innovation so we're always exploring new and emerging technologies.\",\n",
       "    \"But I wouldn't want to say anything beyond that.\",\n",
       "    \"We'll take our next question from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America.\",\n",
       "    'Luca, you mentioned revenues to accelerate year over year overall in September versus your June growth rate. Would you say that it would be reasonable to assume normal quarter-on-quarter seasonality of about $7 billion or so? Or would you say there are additional puts and takes this time around that could drive upside and downside to that? I know you noted 600 bps year over year on FX as potentially one of those. But maybe help us think through, on a sequential basis, how much of a normal versus abnormal seasonality we should expect? And I have a follow-up.',\n",
       "    \"Yes, Wamsi, as you know, as we said earlier, we're not providing guidance because of all the uncertainty out there. But we have given a few data points. So one of them, which you've mentioned, approximately 600 basis points of negative foreign exchange. I mean, you do a rough math, it's around $5 billion.\",\n",
       "    \"That's a big number right there that is going to affect us, that we are having some impact from the situation in Russia and that is obviously different from normal seasonality as well. Our supply constraints, as Tim just said, are going to be lower than what we've seen in the June quarter but they're still going to be there. So when you look at those three headwinds and you combine them with the acceleration that we talked about, we feel that that is pretty remarkable.\",\n",
       "    \"Yes. Let me expand a little bit on Wearables, Home, and Accessories so that I clearly communicate what we saw. We saw sort of a cocktail of headwinds on Wearables, Home, and Accessories. We saw FX, which we've talked about.\",\n",
       "    \"We'll take our next question from Samik Chatterjee with J.P. Morgan.\",\n",
       "    \"Great. And congrats on the results in this tough macro. I guess I wanted to start with China smartphone market here a bit. Tim, I thought you said in response to earlier question that you haven't really seen a material impact from the macro on iPhone yet.\",\n",
       "    'But wondering, did you see an impact of the COVID lockdowns there on demand itself? Or was there a snapback fall in that? If you can comment about the sort of exit run rate that you saw in that market, following the COVID shutdowns ending there. And I have a follow-up.',\n",
       "    'Yes, both things are true. We did see a lower demand based on the COVID lockdowns in the cities the COVID lockdowns affected. And we did see a rebound in those same cities toward the end of the quarter in the June time frame. And in particular, in the run-up to June 18, which as you know, is a major shopping holiday in China.',\n",
       "    'We think that the net of that was still a negative, but some of it did rebound by June time frame. The restrictions begin to come off toward the beginning of June, if my memory is correct.',\n",
       "    \"OK. And for my follow-up, I know you said you don't want to sort of predict the macro here or be an economist. But if I go back and look at the sort of opex for the last few years, you've been increasing that by a double-digit percentage. And just given the uncertainty that you've talked about in the macro further on this call a lot, how are you thinking about sort of that investment base going forward? Are you trying to look at areas that where you can sort of pull back? I mean, just in terms of how you're preparing for the uncertainty is I guess the question.\",\n",
       "    \"We believe in investing through the downturn. And so we'll continue to hire people and invest in areas, but we are being more deliberate in doing so in recognition of the realities of the environment.\",\n",
       "    \"We'll take our next question from Jim Suva with Citigroup.\",\n",
       "    \"While I'm calling you on my iPhone 13 Max Pro and loving it, I just wanted to ask you, though, with replacement cycles, have you noticed any change now that we've been through like two and a half years of COVID where people upgrading at a different rate and kind of post-COVID, hopefully, upgrade cycles or replacement cycles, how we should kind of think about that? Obviously, when I drop and break my phone, I replace it immediately. But a normal replacement, have they changed at all? Any insights from that would be great.\",\n",
       "    \"It's challenging to measure the replacement cycle at any point in time with exact precision, and so I'm going to punt on the question a bit. However, our key task is to make a product that everybody loves and that they want to trade in their current phone to get. And so that's what we are focused on is innovating like crazy and giving somebody something that they really want and see themselves using.\",\n",
       "    \"OK, that makes sense. Well, then maybe I can ask Luca a question more on the gross margins. As you look ahead, the supply chain issues, expedited shipping and all of that, do you think probably the September quarter is kind of the worst of FX and all those headwinds and things? Or is there a little bit of timing delays due to your contractual purchase commitments that you do, that maybe your suppliers are looking at higher costs and you're benefiting from some lower contracts or maybe that has already caught up? If you could give us some insights on the kind of longer-term nature of the directions or the gross margin impacts.\",\n",
       "    \"Jim, I would say we provide guidance for the current quarter. But if we look ahead, there's always a couple of elements in gross margin that are a bit outside of our control and we need to be mindful of that. One of them is the foreign exchange environment. That is having an impact already for the September quarter, had an impact on June.\",\n",
       "    \"And obviously, strong dollar tends to be a headwind for us. As you know, we have a hedging program and so we mitigate that impact. But over time, those hedges roll off and so it becomes more challenging for us. We'll see what happens with foreign exchange rates over time.\",\n",
       "    'That is going to be a variable that we need to track. The other one that has an impact on the aggregate gross margin is our mix of products and services. As you know, they have different margin profiles for very different reasons, different businesses, even different accounting treatment at times. And so that is also something that we will need to track over time.',\n",
       "    \"What matters to us, I think it goes back to Tim was saying earlier, is we want to make sure that people love our products and services, and we want all of them to be equally successful in the marketplace. Certainly, as you've seen over the last year, we've had a significant expansion in gross margins in spite of very difficult economic circumstances from COVID to inflation, interest rates going up and our margins have expanded. From a commodity standpoint, I think you were asking a question around components. Commodities are behaving OK.\",\n",
       "    'Congratulations to you and all your team members.',\n",

       "    \"We'll take our next question from Krish Sankar with Cowen and Company.\",\n",
       "    \"And, Tim, I apologize, it's also macro-related. You mentioned that it impacted digital advertising within Services. I'm just kind of curious, if the macro does worsen, do you worry about subscriber growth, App Store purchases, etc.? And conversely, are there any parts of the Service business that you consider recession-proof, like maybe a buy now, pay later, or something else? And then I have a quick follow-up for Luca.\",\n",
       "    \"We have incorporated all of our thoughts in the guidance that Luca gave, which says that we think in the aggregate, we're going to accelerate revenues in the September quarter as compared to the June quarter and will decelerate on the Services side. And so we see the digital advertising cloud, if you will, continuing in the current quarter.\",\n",

Services gross margin was 72.6%, up 20 basis points sequentially due to a different mix.',\n",

These strong March quarter results capped a record first half of the fiscal year in the midst of a challenging macroeconomic environment. We generated over $220 billion in revenue, growing 10% year over year, and set all-time records for iPhone, Mac, Wearables, home and accessories and services. These record sales results drove strong double-digit growth in operating income and earnings per share.',\n",

We set March quarter records in both developed and emerging markets, and the latest survey of US consumers from 451 Research indicates iPhone customer satisfaction of 99% for the iPhone 13 family. As a result of this level of sales performance, combined with unmatched customer loyalty, the iPhone active installed base reached a new all-time high across all geographies.',\n",
       "    'For Mac, revenue of $10.4 billion was a March quarter record despite supply constraints, with 15% year-over-year growth driven by strong demand for our M1-powered MacBook Pro. As Tim mentioned earlier, our continued innovation and investment in Apple silicon has clearly shown in our Mac results as the last seven quarters have been the best seven quarter ever for Mac. Our investment focus on Mac has also helped drive significant activity in our growing installed base. In fact, we had a March quarter record for upgraders, while at the same time, nearly half of the customers purchasing a Mac were new to the product.',\n",
       "    'iPad revenue was $7.6 billion, down 2% year over year due to continued supply constraints. Customer response to our iPad lineup, including our new M1-powered iPad Air, remains very strong.

Wearables, home and accessories set a March quarter record of $8.8 billion, up 12% year over year, and we set March quarter revenue records in both developed and emerging markets.',\n",

For instance, Apple Watch continues to extend its reach with over two-thirds of customers purchasing an Apple Watch during the quarter being new to the product. Turning to services. As I mentioned, we reached an all-time revenue record of $19.8 billion, up 17%, with all-time records for the App Store, Music, cloud services and AppleCare and March quarter records for video, advertising and payment services.',\n",

First, our installed base has continued to grow, reaching an all-time high across each geographic segment and major product category. Next, we continue to see increased customer engagement with our services. Our transacting accounts, paid accounts and accounts with paid subscriptions all reached all-time highs during the March quarter in every geographic segment.\",\n",

       "    \"The first is on how you're thinking about consumer spending. As we see more stock market volatility, rising interest rates, inflation, what metrics are you watching either internal to your business or external at the macro level to understand whether you'll ultimately start to see some demand impact particularly on the product side of your business? And then I have a follow-up.\",\n",
       "    \"Katy, hi. It's Tim. We're obviously monitoring our daily sales very closely. From an inflation point of view, we are seeing inflation.\",\n",
       "    \"It is or was evident in our gross margin last quarter and in our opex last quarter, and it is assumed in the guidance that Luca gave for this quarter as well. So we're definitely seeing some level of inflation that I think everybody is seeing.\",\n",
       "    'OK. And as it relates to that, in China, how should we think about lockdowns from an impact on supply and an impact on demand? And what products in your portfolio should we expect to be most impacted? Thank you.',\n",
       "    'Yeah. Good question. For Q2, so the quarter that we just finished, the restrictions in China had not started yet. And so, Q2, we did have supply constraints.',\n",
       "    \"They were significantly lower than what we had experienced during the December quarter. They were driven by industrywide silicon shortages and specifically, the issue that I talked about on previous calls with the legacy nodes. But looking ahead, we see two causes of supply constraints. One is the COVID-related disruptions, and there's the industrywide silicon shortages that will continue.\",\n",
       "    \"We're also encouraged that the COVID case count that's been reported in Shanghai has decreased over the last few days. And so, there's some reason for optimism there.\",\n",

       "    \"And I think Americas grew really well, 19%, 20%. But Europe and China had much more muted growth, if you may. I know your compares are fairly difficult, but I'm curious if anything you would call out in terms of spillover effect on the macro side from Russia, Ukraine, and Europe that's seeing some impact to consumer spend or even in China. Just help us understand what happened geographically there.\",\n",
       "    'So Amit, as you said, in the Americas, we had a very strong quarter, up 19%, very happy across the board there. Europe, again, was a really good quarter for us. We grew 5% in spite of the fact that, of course, as you know, during the month of March, we paused our sales in Russia. So we had an impact to our sales results there for a month of the quarter.',\n",
       "    'But a number of European countries, particularly in Western Europe, did really, really well for us. And so, it was a very good quarter for us, pretty much in line with our expectations. Americas was better than our expectations. China was, again, a March quarter record for us.',\n",
       "    'Keep in mind, and this affected every geographic segment for us, the different launch timing for the iPhone this year versus a year ago had an impact on the March quarter results because we launched the product later a year ago than we did this year. So some of the channel fill for the new products happened during the March quarter a year ago. Japan and Asia Pacific were affected by foreign exchange. Japan would have grown in line with company average in constant currency terms.',\n",
       "    'Asia Pacific as well was affected by foreign exchange with the dollar appreciating against most currencies. And then, again, this difference in the launch timing for the iPhone made a difference. Keep in mind, again, the supply constraints that we had during the quarter, our results would have been obviously better without the supply constraints. Overall, we felt very good about the performance around the world.',\n",
       "    \"Got you. If I could just follow up on the supply chain, the $4 billion to $8 billion impact that you folks talked about. Do you think this is demand that's deferred out or demand that's essentially destroyed because you have a product cycle that's going to come out at some point soon this year? How do you think about demand deferred versus demand destroyed on that front? And then is there a sense of which product categories are most impacted by this versus not?\",\n",

       "    'Yeah, thank you. Good evening. I also just wanted to dig in on the supply constraints a bit. And I guess one of the things you said is that the $4 billion to $8 billion range reflects some reopening of facilities during the quarter.',\n",
       "    \"I know, obviously, it's tough to predict as you go forward into the second half of launch of new products. But at that point, would you expect the constraints to still be mainly on the component side and then hopefully, if things don't get worse in China, then the facilities are open and the constraints are only the component constraints as you go into the second half of the year?\",\n",

       "    'And should we expect it to have similar pro rata impacts? And is there an opportunity to maybe reallocate resources to limit maybe some of the impact on the iPhone line and then maybe versus the iPad line? And then I have a quick follow-up.',\n",
       "    'It will affect most of the product categories, and we obviously will look to do any kind of optimization that we can do to minimize the effect on the user.',\n",
       "    \"Great. And then, maybe just as a follow-up. You talked about potential COVID-related demand issues in China and taking out 150 basis points from Russia. But when you look at the other geographies, is there anything that you can share with us, whether it's in Western Europe or the US, that you're seeing from a demand perspective that may be sort of out of the ordinary or outside of sort of the disruptions? I mean the lack of product demand seems to be sort of where you would think it would be at this point in the cycle.\",\n",
       "    'Thank you.',\n",
       "    'We were happy with the iPhone growth last quarter, particularly when you think about the comp that it was going against because we had very different timing on the launches in the year ago quarter where we launched in Q1. And therefore, naturally, Q2 is at a different place on the new product curve. And so, it was a very difficult comp. And so, we were pleased with it.',\n",
       "    'And as Luca said, the Americas geography did quite well last quarter. And the US, of course, is the major geography within there. And so, the US was quite strong last quarter.',\n",

Tim, and your entire company has done a great job at navigating through all the issues in the past several years, whether it be COVID, power outages, trade wars, shipping challenges and all that. When we hopefully someday get past all of these and the supply constraints and society and turmoil hopefully across the world, do you start to reconsider the way you do the supply chain albeit just-in-time ordering and outsourcing so much of your chips? Or do you actually consider like holding more buffer inventory internally because right now, letting $4 billion to $8 billion go away, it'd be nice to have that to be able to sell. So do you consider holding more buffer inventory or maybe even doing your own chips by outsourcing your own chips to control them more? Or how should we think about strategically when hopefully the world is in a better place from today?\",\n",
       "    \"Well, I'm looking forward to that day, as I know all of you are. Our supply chain is truly global. And so, the products are made everywhere, and we do a lot in the US We'll probably be doing even more here as more chips are produced here. And we continue to look at optimizing.\",\n",
       "    \"We don't have a tin ear. And so, to the degree that we learn something that we should change, you can bet that we're doing that. In this business, you don't want to hold a ton of inventory. And so, you want to work on cycle times and so forth to do things very quickly and take strategic inventory in places where you need to buffer for interruptions and so forth.\",\n",
       "    \"And so, we're constantly thinking about where those places are. In today's world, it's not really possible for us to have buffer on silicon. And so, today, silicon rolls off the fab and it's into a final assembly plant very, very quickly, and we try to make that as shorter time as possible.\",\n",
       "    \"And then my quick follow-up, we've been talking about supply chain issues for multiple quarters now. Are you kind of hearing from your suppliers that maybe latter half of this year? Or is it actually going to go into kind of 2013 for some closer equilibrium time period?\",\n",
       "    'Thank you. And congratulations to you and your entire team.',\n",

And I have a quick follow-up for Luca. Thank you.\",\n",
       "    \"Yeah. We don't get to that level of granularity because we view it to be sensitive data that our competitors would love to have. And so, I'm going to punt on answering that question. I would just say that when you zoom out and look at iPhone as a total, we could not be happier with the iPhone 13 family of products and the strength we've seen for this cycle.\",\n",
       "    \"And really, it's those products that have powered the line and given us the overall results that we've had on iPhone, which, for the first half, the revenues were $120 billion, and we feel very, very good about those results.\",\n",

       "    'We have a lot of momentum for a variety of reasons. The first one is the fact that our installed base of active devices continues to grow very nicely. And so, that is obviously a big engine for our services business. The second thing is that the level of engagement that we see on our platform continues to grow.',\n",
       "    \"We have more transacting accounts, more paying accounts, more accounts with subscriptions. The absolute amount of paid subscriptions on our platform is pretty impressive, 825 million.

       "    \"We are looking at it from the lens of continuing to satisfy our customers, adding to the portfolio, improving the quality of the services. And that has served us very well because in the last 12 months, we've generated $75 billion of services revenue, and you've seen the margins are obviously accretive to company margin. So we feel good, we feel good about the services business. I mentioned in my prepared remarks that the growth rate for the June quarter, we expect it to be less than the 17% that we've reported in March for some of the reasons that I described.\",\n",
       "    'Of course, foreign exchange is an issue with the dollar being strong at this point. And of course, we paused our sales in Russia. So we need to take that into account.

Luca, if I try to read the series based on June quarter guidance, revenue is being impacted, kind of implies year over year down revenue.',\n",

I'm just kind of curious, do you think the last three quarters Apple supply chain had a better buffer inventory of semis that kind of got used up and now you're kind of more tied to whatever the true supply constraints of legacy semis is? Or is there something else going on? And then I had a follow-up.\",\n",
       "    \"What has happened, obviously, during COVID has changed over the quarters. Recently, for example, during the March quarter, the constraints that we had were limited to silicon shortages. When we are giving out this range of $4 billion to $8 billion, it's not only silicon, but it's the restrictions in China that we're seeing right now. So they are different.\",\n",

And I have a follow-up.',\n",
       "    'The COVID-related disruptions did not affect the March quarter. So you need to keep that in mind. With respect to foreign exchange, we expect it to be nearly 300 basis points headwind. It was about 200 basis points headwind during the March quarter.',\n",
       "    \"For Russia, we said that the impact on a year-over-year basis is approximately 150 basis points. That reflects the three months of the quarter. We paused sales in Russia at the beginning of March, so it was a partial impact on the March quarter. So obviously, on a sequential basis, it's an incremental factor to keep in mind.\",\n",
       "    \"So the iPhone 13 has been truly a global success. And as you know and as you can tell from our website, most of the iPad and Mac models are constrained today. They've been constrained for several quarters because the demand is very good for those products. And the services business, as you know, is growing double digits.\",\n",

       "   'content': [\"Good day, and welcome to the Apple Q1 FY 2022 earnings conference call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Tejas Gala, director of investor relations and corporate finance. Please go ahead.\",\n",
       "    \"Thank you. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. Speaking first today is Apple's CEO, Tim Cook; and he'll be followed by CFO, Luca Maestri. After that, we'll open the call to questions from analysts.\",\n",
       "    \"Please note that some of the information you'll hear during our discussion today will consist of forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, those regarding revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, other income and expense, taxes, capital allocation, and future business outlook, including the potential impact of COVID-19 on the company's business and results of operations. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results or trends to differ materially from our forecast. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in Apple's most recently filed annual report on Form 10-K and the Form 8-K filed with the SEC today, along with the associated press release. Apple assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements or information, which speak as of their respective dates.\",\n",
       "    \"I'd now like to turn the call over to Tim for introductory remarks.\",\n",
       "    \"Thank you, Tejas, and good afternoon. Today, we are proud to announce Apple's biggest quarter ever. Through the busy holiday season, we set an all-time revenue record of nearly $124 billion, up 11% from last year and better than we had expected at the beginning of the quarter. And we are pleased to see that our active installed base of devices is now at a new record with more than 1.8 billion devices.\",\n",
       "    'We set all-time records for both developed and emerging markets and saw revenue growth across all of our product categories, except for iPad, which we said would be supply constrained. As expected, in the aggregate, we experienced supply constraints that were higher than the September quarter. Before I discuss our results in greater detail, I want to first acknowledge the toll that COVID continues to have on communities around the world. In many places, case counts are higher and health systems more strained than at any point throughout the pandemic.',\n",
       "    \"On behalf of all of us at Apple, I want to extend our deep gratitude to the scientists, doctors, nurses, and so many others on the front lines of combating COVID-19. This is our eighth quarter reporting results in the shadow of the pandemic. And while I can't say it gets any easier, I can say I'm incredibly proud of the way our teams have come together and continue to innovate on behalf of our customers. A few weeks ago, we marked the 15th anniversary of the day Steve revealed iPhone to the world.\",\n",
       "    'We knew that we had the beginnings of something fundamentally transformative, though none of us could have predicted the incredible and meaningful impact it would have on all of our lives. The creative spirit that made the first iPhone possible has thrived at Apple every day since. We never stop creating. We never stop innovating.',\n",
       "    \"You can see that spirit reflected throughout our products from the incredible performance and capability of our M1 chips to our powerful yet easily use operating systems to our unrivaled iPhone camera systems to the beauty and magic of AirPods. That's why each of our major products leads the industry in customer satisfaction for their respective category. People expect Apple to solve hard problems with easy-to-use products. And iPhone has never been more popular.\",\n",
       "    \"During the December quarter, we set an all-time revenue record for iPhone, thanks to the strength of our incredible iPhone 13 lineup. This is the best iPhone lineup we've ever had, and the reaction from the press and our users have been off the charts. This past quarter, we also set another all-time revenue record for Mac, with customers eager to get their hands on an M1-powered MacBook Air, iMac, or MacBook Pro. We've been thrilled with the response from Pro users to the M1 Pro and M1 Max chips and to see how Apple silicon is blowing them away with its power, performance, and efficiency.\",\n",
       "    'Despite the constraints I mentioned earlier, our iPad lineup continues to be indispensable to tens of millions of people from teachers and students to artists and creators. Customers are eager to get their hands on our ninth generation iPad, which features a beautiful display and double the storage capacity, as well as the new iPad mini with its ultra-portable design. Wearables, Home, and Accessories, meanwhile, set an all-time revenue record. Customers are loving the Apple Watch Series 7 with its cutting-edge health and fitness tracking features.',\n",
       "    \"Nearly every day, I get notes from customers who share how a heart alert led to a life-saving appointment with the cardiologist. And more recently, I've been hearing from people who tell me that their Apple Watch saved their lives by calling 911 when they couldn't. As I've said, we're still in the early innings with our health work, but every day, I am encouraged by our positive impact. We are also making great advancements in audio and are seeing strong demand from customers as a result.\",\n",
       "    \"The HomePod mini continues to earn praise for combining the intelligence of Siri with an immersive room-filling audio experience. And our customers have responded with a lot of excitement to the magic of spatial audio on AirPods, which packs the acoustics of a concert hall. As always, the deep integration of hardware, software, and services is a hallmark of everything Apple makes. It's a principle you can see at work in the introduction of SharePlay, a feature that offers a whole new way to create shared experiences by letting users watch and listen to their favorite content together on FaceTime.\",\n",
       "    \"And we continue to invest in innovation across our services business, which set another all-time revenue record last quarter and performed even better than we had anticipated. The App Store continues to be an economic miracle for developers around the world and a safe and trusted place for consumers to discover their favorite apps. Since its launch, we have paid developers selling digital goods and services more than $260 billion, with 2021 setting a new record for their earnings. I'm also happy to report that in its first two years, Apple TV+ shows and movies have earned 200 award wins and more than 890 nominations.\",\n",
       "    'Among the powerful lineup are feature films like \"The Tragedy of Macbeth,\" \"CODA,\" and \"Swan Song,\" along with many gripping new series coming up, including \"Severance\" and \"The Afterparty.\" Each one is a tremendous credit to all the storytellers in front of the cameras and behind them who touched audiences all over the world. Fitness+, meanwhile, continues to inspire customers to reach their health and fitness goals. We recently introduced \"Time to Run,\" an extension of our popular series \"Time to Walk,\" as well as new collections of workouts and meditations to help users make more intentional training choices. Despite the pandemic, our retail businesses saw its highest revenue in Apple\\'s history, and we also earned our highest ever customer satisfaction scores.',\n",
       "    \"That is a testament to the incredible adaptability our teams have shown as we've reimagined retail experience. I also want to take a moment to thank our retail employees and AppleCare teams for the deep care you've given to our customers as they look to get the most out of our products, learn new skills, or track down the perfect gift. We have always led with our values and with compassion and care and never has that been more needed than during the pandemic. Last quarter, we celebrated 10 years of our Employee Giving program, which we started to help our employees identify and support the causes they care most deeply about.\",\n",
       "    \"We pledged to match their contributions to organizations doing important work at every level from their local food pantry to global humanitarian nonprofits. In the last decade, this program has contributed nearly $725 million to charitable organizations. We also celebrated 15 years of Apple's partnership with a global fund on (PRODUCT)RED, supporting their life-saving work to expand healthcare services in sub-Saharan Africa for people living with HIV/AIDS. With the support of our customers, we've now raised nearly $270 million to fund prevention, testing, and counselling services for people impacted by HIV/AIDS.\",\n",
       "    'And in keeping with our abiding belief in and commitment to education, we also launched a new partnership with the Boys & Girls Clubs of America. This initiative will help young people across the U.S. learn to code on iPad using our Everyone Can Code Curriculum. And we are continuing to drive innovations to help combat climate change.',\n",
       "    'We are already carbon neutral across our own operations, and we are working intensely to meet our 2030 goal of carbon neutrality across our supply chain and the life cycle of our products. To celebrate Black History Month, we will be releasing a special edition Apple Watch Black Unity Braided Solo Loop and a matching Unity Lights Watch face. And through our racial equity and justice initiative, we are continuing to support organizations blazing trails to a more equitable world in our economies, our classrooms, and our criminal justice system. We recognize, as ever, that it takes all of us to confront our most profound challenges.',\n",
       "    'And at Apple, we are determined to do our part. That includes our own work and inclusion and diversity, which we are advancing every day. Let me close by saying that despite the uncertainty of the world, there is one thing of which I am certain: Apple will continue to end every day and in every way to deliver on the promise of technology at its best. I will now turn it over to Luca to go over our quarterly results in more detail.',\n",
       "    'Thank you, Tim, and good afternoon, everyone. We are very pleased to report record financial results for the December quarter. We set an all-time revenue record of $123.9 billion, an 11% increase from a year ago. We reached new all-time records in the Americas, Europe, Greater China, and the rest of Asia-Pacific.',\n",
       "    'And it was also an all-time record quarter for both products and services. On the product side, revenue was $104.4 billion, up 9% over a year ago, despite significant supply constraints. We grew in each of our product categories, except iPad, where supply constraints were particularly pronounced, and set all-time records for iPhone; Mac; and wearables, home and accessories. The strong level of sales performance, the unmatched loyalty of our customers, and the strength of our ecosystem have driven our current installed base of active devices to a new all-time record of 1.8 billion devices.',\n",
       "    'The growth in the installed base were broad-based as we set all-time records in each major product category and in each geographic segment. Our services set an all-time revenue record of $19.5 billion, up 24% over a year ago, with December quarter records in every geographic segment. Company gross margin was 43.8%, up 160 basis points from last quarter due to volume leverage and favorable mix, partially offset by higher cost structures. Products gross margin was 38.4%, up 410 basis points sequentially, driven by leverage and mix.',\n",
       "    'Services gross margin was 72.4%, up 190 basis points sequentially, mainly due to a different mix. Net income of $34.6 billion and diluted earnings per share of $2.10, both grew more than 20% year over year and were all-time records. Operating cash flow of $47 billion was also an all-time record. Let me get into more detail for each of our revenue categories.',\n",
       "    'iPhone revenue grew 9% year over year to an all-time record of $71.6 billion despite supply constraints, thanks to a remarkable customer response to our new iPhone 13 family. We set all-time records in both developed and emerging markets, reached all-time high in the iPhone active installed base. And the latest survey of U.S. consumers from 451 Research indicates iPhone customer satisfaction of 98%.',\n",
       "    'For Mac, revenue of $10.9 billion was an all-time record with growth of 25% year over year, driven by strong demand for our newly redesigned MacBook Pro powered by M1, despite supply constraints. We are one year into our transition to Apple silicon. And already, the vast majority of our Mac sales are from M1-powered devices, which helped drive a record number of upgraders during the December quarter. Our momentum in this category is very impressive as the last six quarters have been the best six quarters ever for Mac.',\n",
       "    'iPad generated $7.2 billion in revenue, down 14% year over year due to very significant supply constraints, but customer demand was very strong across all models. Despite the supply shortages, our installed base of iPads reached a new all-time high during the quarter, thanks to a high number of customers that are new to iPad. In fact, around half of the customers purchasing an iPad during the quarter were new to the product. wearables, home and accessories set a new all-time record of $14.7 billion, up 13% year over year.',\n",
       "    'And we set all-time revenue records in each geographic segment. We also continue to improve and expand our product offerings in this category to create unique experiences showcasing our deep integration of hardware, software, and services. In addition to an outstanding level of sales performance globally, Apple Watch continues to extend its reach, with over two-thirds of customers purchasing an Apple Watch during the quarter being new to the product. Turning to services.',\n",
       "    'As I mentioned, we reached an all-time revenue record of $19.5 billion, up 24%, with all-time records for cloud services, for music, video, advertising, and payment services, and a December quarter record for the App Store. These impressive results reflect the positive momentum we are seeing on many fronts. First, as I mentioned before, our installed base has continued to grow and has reached an all-time high across each geographic segment and major product category. Next, we continue to see increased customer engagement with our services.',\n",
       "    \"The number of paid accounts on our digital content stores grew double digits and reached a new all-time high during the December quarter in every geographic segment. Also, paid subscriptions continue to show very strong growth. We now have more than 785 million paid subscriptions across the services on our platform, which is up 165 million during the last 12 months alone. And finally, we're adding new services that we think our customers will love, and we continue to improve the breadth and quality of our current service offerings.\",\n",
       "    \"Just in this last quarter, we have added incredible new content on Apple TV+, on Fitness+ and Apple Arcade and a brand-new way to listen to music with Apple Music Voice. We also announced in November the beta program for Apple Business Essentials, a new service offering that brings together device management 24/7 support and iCloud storage to our small businesses, manage the end-to-end life cycle of their employees' Apple devices. We are very excited that many thousands of small business customers are already actively participating in the beta program. This announcement is just one of many ways we are expanding our support for enterprise and business customers.\",\n",
       "    \"With the latest Macbook Pros that we've introduced last October, the new M1-powered Mac lineup has quickly become the preferred choice of Max among enterprise customers. Shopify, for example, is upgrading its entire global workforce to M1-powered MacBook Pro and MacBook Air. By standardizing on M1 Max, Shopify continues its commitment to providing the best tools to help its employees work productively and securely from anywhere. And Deloitte Consulting is expanding the deployment of the Mac Employee Choice program, including offering the new M1 MacBook Pro to empower their professionals to choose devices that work best for them in delivering consulting services.\",\n",
       "    'Let me now turn to our cash position. Due to our strong operating performance and holiday quarter seasonality, we ended the quarter with $203 billion in cash, plus marketable securities. We decreased commercial paper by $1 billion, leaving us with total debt of $123 billion. As a result, net cash was $80 billion at the end of the quarter.',\n",
       "    \"Our business continues to generate very strong cash flow, and we're also able to return nearly $27 billion to shareholders during the December quarter. This included $3.7 billion in dividends and equivalents and $14.4 billion through open market repurchases of 93 million Apple shares. We also began $6 billion accelerated share repurchase program in November, resulting in the initial delivery and retirement of 30 million shares. As we move ahead into the March quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Tejas referred to at the beginning of the call.\",\n",
       "    'Given the continued uncertainty around the world in the near term, we are not providing revenue guidance, but we are sharing some directional insights based on the assumption that the COVID-related impacts to our business do not worsen from what we are projecting today for the current quarter. We expect to achieve solid year-over-year revenue growth and set a March quarter revenue record despite significant supply constraints, which we estimate to be less than what we experienced during the December quarter. We expect our revenue growth rate to decelerate from the December quarter, primarily due to two factors. First, during the March quarter a year ago, we grew revenue by 54%.',\n",
       "    'Remember that last year, we launched our new iPhones during the December quarter. While this year, we launched them during the September quarter. Due to the later launch a year ago, some of the associated channel inventory fill occurred during the March quarter last year. As a result of the different launch timing, we will face a more challenging year-over-year compare.',\n",
       "    'Second, we expect foreign exchange to be a 3-point headwind when compared to the December quarter growth rate. We currently expect FX to have a negative impact on growth of 2 points in the March quarter, while it represented a 1-point benefit during the December quarter. Specifically related to services, we expect to grow strong double digits but decelerate from the December quarter performance. This is due to a more challenging compare because a higher level of lockdowns around the world last year led to increased usage of digital content and services.',\n",
       "    'We expect gross margin to be between 42.5% and 43.5%. We expect opex to be between $12.5 billion and $12.7 billion. We expect OI&E to be around negative $150 million, excluding any potential impact from the mark-to-market of minority investments, and our tax rate to be around 16%. Finally, today, our board of directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.22 per share of common stock payable on February 10, 2022, to shareholders of record as of February 7, 2022.',\n",
       "    \"And with that, let's open the call to questions.\",\n",
       "    'Thank you, Luca. We ask that you limit yourself to two questions. Operator, may we have the first question, please?',\n",
       "    'Questions & Answers:',\n",
       "    \"Absolutely. We'll take our first question from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. Katy, please check your mute function, we weren't able to hear you. Hearing no response, we'll take our next question from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America.\",\n",
       "    \"Yes, thank you. Your margins have clearly been very impressive. So I have one question each on product and one on services gross margins. On product gross margins, that's clearly benefiting from a very strong mix.\",\n",
       "    \"So, Tim, I'm curious how sustainable do you think these mix trends are from the data that you see? And can you share any thoughts across how the Pro and Pro Max mix compared to prior cycles? And on the services side, if I could just ask that, too. When you look at the gross margins there, that's been really impressive. Can you give us some sense of where within services you're seeing particularly favorable mix trends? And how should investors think about the trajectory of these margins given some of the sizable investments you're making to drive very successful areas like content for TV+ as an example? Thank you.\",\n",
       "    \"Wamsi, it's Tim. In terms of the mix, you know, we don't comment directly on mix. But what I would tell you is that we saw strong demand across the iPhone 13 family. And in fact, we had several of the top-selling models in various markets, including the top five in the U.S.\",\n",
       "    \"and Australia, the top four in Urban China, two of the top three in the U.K., three of the top four in France and Germany, and four of the top six in Japan. And certainly, based on some external data that I've seen, it does seem to say that we are gaining share as well. So we feel quite good about the momentum of iPhone. And I should add that we were constrained during the quarter.\",\n",
       "    'Wamsi, on the services side, you were asking about gross margin there. As you know, our services business in aggregate is accretive to overall company margin. And as you know, our services portfolio is very broad, and it contains businesses with very different margin profiles. The difference in margin profile is due in part to the nature of those businesses and in part to the way that we account for them, in some cases, we account on a net basis as opposed to a gross basis.',\n",
       "    \"And so as a result, the Services gross margin percentage over time will be influenced by the relative growth of the different businesses within the portfolio. We do not guide at the product and services level, but I think you've seen the guidance that we provided for the March quarter at the total company level, 42.5% to 43.5%, obviously very strong compared to our recent history. And so we're very pleased with that.\",\n",
       "    'Thanks, Tim. Thanks, Luca.',\n",
       "    'Thanks, Wamsi. Can we have the next question, please?',\n",
       "    \"We'll take our next question from Kyle McNealy with Jefferies.\",\n",
       "    \"Hi, thanks very much. Congrats on the solid iPhone result. That's very good. I assume that you may have prioritized iPhone to the extent there may be similar components that are used for iPhone and iPad.\",\n",
       "    \"Can you just level set me on that if that's not the case? And if it is, should we see a recovery in iPad as you move past your prime iPhone selling season and you may have better access to components or better supply as we move through the next few months of the year?\",\n",
       "    \"If you look at the commonality between different products, there is some. But generally, the challenge is on legacy nodes. And these legacy nodes are by supplier. And so it's much more focused on the supplier than anything else and versus us behind the curtain finding a place to take it.\",\n",
       "    \"OK. Great. Can you give us any other color on kind of the trajectory of iPad and, you know, what's impacting this quarter and where it might go in the March and the June quarter?\",\n",
       "    'OK, great, thanks so much. Congrats again on the solid results all around.',\n",
       "    'Oh, thanks very much.',\n",
       "    'Thank you, Kyle. Can we have the next question, please?',\n",
       "    \"Thank you. We'll take our next question from Shannon Cross with Cross Research.\",\n",
       "    \"Thank you very much. Tim, could you talk a bit about the Mac business? Looking back, it's up about 50% from the calendar 2019 revenue. You did almost $11 billion this quarter, and you're still working through the M1 transition. So can you talk about where you see the opportunity to gain share? What are really sort of the target markets that you think you can go after, you know, in order to grow this beyond, I think it was about $37 billion in the last 12 months? Thank you.\",\n",
       "    'And then I have a follow-up.',\n",
       "    'Yeah. Shannon, thank you for the question. Mac set an all-time revenue record at $10.9 billion for the quarter. That was up 25%.',\n",
       "    \"And as you point out, the last six quarters for the Mac have been the top six revenue quarters of all time. And what's further very good about this is, we set all-time revenue records in Americas, in Europe, and the rest of Asia Pacific. And we set a December quarter record in Greater China. And so it's not narrowed to a particular geographic area that we're doing well in.\",\n",
       "    'OK. Thank you.',\n",
       "    'Thanks. Can we have the next question, please?',\n",
       "    \"We'll hear next from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley.\",\n",
       "    'Thank you. Can you hear me OK?',\n",
       "    'Now we can.',\n",
       "    'Yes.',\n",
       "    \"OK. Good. So first question, just as it relates to some of the disruption you've seen on the component side, manufacturing and logistics over the past couple of years. Are you starting to rethink your broader supply chain strategy or the manufacturing footprint on the back of the significant disruption? Are you happy with the overall geographic exposure that you see in the supply chain today?\",\n",
       "    \"Katy, if you sort of step back and look at how we've done, our largest issue by far has been the chip shortage. That is industrywide and on these legacy nodes, as I had mentioned earlier. And I think our supply chain actually does very good considering the shortages because it's a fast-moving supply chain. The cycle times are very short.\",\n",
       "    \"OK. And how are you thinking about the metaverse opportunity and Apple's role in that market?\",\n",
       "    'Right now, we have over 14,000 AR kit apps in the App Store, which provide incredible AR experiences for millions of people today. And so we see a lot of potential in this space and are investing accordingly.',\n",
       "    'Thanks. Can we take the next question, please?',\n",
       "    \"Thank you. We'll take our next question from Amit Daryanani with Evercore.\",\n",
       "    \"I have two as well. I guess both up on the supply chain side, I think these continue to be fairly volatile. I'd love to get your perspective, if you feel, if things or supply chain issues are starting to alleviate or they still remain challenging. And then maybe I missed this, but could you perhaps tell us how much revenue was left on the table in December because of the supply chain issues? And how does that number shake up in March?\",\n",
       "    \"Yeah. Amit, what we've said in terms of December and March was that it's very difficult to estimate with great precision the constraints. But we said that they would be more than the Q4 or more than the September quarter, and we're saying that March will be less than the December quarter. And so that's the kind of verbiage that we placed around it.\",\n",
       "    \"In terms of is it still challenging, yes, it is challenging. And for us, we pride ourselves on getting products to customers who really want them and try to do that in a fast basis. And so it's frustrating that we can't always do that at the speed that we would like. However, March is better than December.\",\n",
       "    \"And so there's some encouraging sign there. We're not predicting with the [Inaudible] overall, obviously, because of the number of variables that go into such a prediction.\",\n",
       "    \"Fair enough. Tim, I think one of the topics investors can struggle a fair a bit with Apple is really just sort of understand visibility around your product road map, and I think some of your tech peers tend to be more vocal about their initiative. Some of them go change their name when they find an initiative. You folks are spending, I think, $23 billion on R&D in '21.\",\n",
       "    \"So you're really spending a fair amount. And maybe without telling us the road map, could you just talk about how do you think about where to focus your R&D resources on? And to some extent, is the way to think about this R&D spend, how much of it is really done on things that are more evolutionary in products that are out in the marketplace versus things that we haven't seen yet are on potential new offerings?\",\n",
       "    \"You know, we have a little different model. We tried to announce things when they're ready or close to ready and try to maintain an element of surprise in the air. And so that explains, hopefully, what we do with our roadmap. And I think that's proven successful for us.\",\n",
       "    \"And other people can do it differently, of course. But it's been good for us over time to do that. So, we're going to continue to do that. In terms of deciding where we invest in, we look at areas that are sort of at the intersection of hardware, software, and services.\",\n",
       "    \"And because we think that that's where the magic really happens, and it brings out the best in our home, and so there are areas that have more than piqued our interest, and we are investing in those. And you can tell through time that we've wrapped our R&D spend even more than we were before. And so, there's quite a bit of investment going into things that are not on the market at this point, as there always are. Thanks for the question.\",\n",
       "    'Perfect. Thank you.',\n",
       "    'Thanks. Can we have the next question, please?',\n",
       "    \"Thank you. We'll hear next from David Vogt with UBS.\",\n",
       "    \"Great. Thanks for taking my call and my question. I just wanted to dive in to your perspective on China and sort of the macroclimate there and how that sort of pertains to your business as we think about it going forward. And the reason why I'm asking is we've heard some concerns that current policies might have caused a pause in this market and smartphone inventory.\",\n",
       "    \"Maybe more specifically the local vendors could be a little bit elevated going into Chinese New Year. So we just want to get your thoughts on what you're seeing in this market around, the sort of potential development, and then maybe touch on sell-in versus sell-through in that market. And then I have a follow-up.\",\n",
       "    \"Well, I can only comment on for us. Our sales grew 21% there in the last quarter, and we're very proud of that. I'll stay away and let other people be the economist and make the macro determinations. But what we're seeing there was super impressive with all-time revenue records and a record number of upgraders and strong double-digit growth in switchers on iPhone, which is very important to us.\",\n",
       "    \"And as I've mentioned before, we had the top four selling phones in urban China. And so there's a lot of good there. And I would remind you that iPhone was constrained in the quarter. And so I'm not sure where the statements are coming around about inventory, and I can't comment on whether other people have more or not.\",\n",
       "    \"I don't know the answer to that. Thanks for the question.\",\n",
       "    \"That's helpful, Tim. And then maybe just on the supply chain. You know, obviously, you've been managing it incredibly well over the last 12 to 18 months. And gross margins have actually performed relatively well, mix driven both between products and services.\",\n",

       "    \"Thank you. We'll take the question from Samik Chatterjee with J.P. Morgan.\",\n",
       "    \"Oh, great, thanks for taking my question. I had a couple. The first question that I had was really on Apple TV+, and I know some of the other players in this market have talked about slowing subscriber growth as we exit the pandemic. So curious if you can share what trends you're seeing in Apple TV and Apple TV+ and how similar or dissimilar they are and how your content is maybe helping you on that aspect? And I have a follow-up.\",\n",
       "    \"That's a huge growth on a year-over-year basis of 165 million. And it counts, as you recall, both Apple branded and third party. In terms of how we're doing with TV+, we've been honored with 200 wins and 890 nominations. We're doing exactly like we had wanted to, giving storytellers a place to tell original stories and feel really good about where we are competitively and strategic position of the product.\",\n",
       "    'OK. Congrats on the results.',\n",
       "    'Thanks so much.',\n",
       "    'Thanks. Can we have the next question, please?',\n",
       "    \"Thank you. We'll take our next question from Chris Caso with Raymond James.\",\n",
       "    'Yes, thank you. Good evening. First question is just a little bit of help in interpreting the guidance. And if you could speak to the March quarter, perhaps in terms of seasonality and seasonal performance.',\n",
       "    'And Luca, as you mentioned last year, because of the later launch of the phone that some of that came into the March quarter, and that was better than seasonal performance in March. Should we interpret because the supply constraints are easing somewhat as you go into the March quarter that we should see something similar that March quarter would get some better than seasonal performance? Is that the correct way to interpret your guidance?',\n",
       "    \"Well, you know, and we talked about it on a year-over-year basis because that's probably how most people look at it. And so just to recap what we said. First of all, we expect a record for the March quarter. We expect solid growth on a year-over-year basis.\",\n",
       "    \"OK. Thank you, sir. As a follow-up, a follow-up question is on perhaps the sustainability and repeatability of the growth in iPhone after two very good years, well-received product and the 5G upgrade cycle. And I think there was a point in time when perhaps there's a view from some that iPhone was x growth, and that's been proven wrong.\",\n",
       "    'Off of these very strong results, maybe you can speak to your level of confidence that iPhone continues to grow in the future and kind of what are the avenues for that growth.',\n",
       "    \"Yeah. Hey, Chris, it's Tim. What I would say is that the iPhone has become an integral part of so many people's lives now more than ever. And the active installed base of iPhone continues to grow and is now at an all-time high.\",\n",
       "    'We maintain a very optimistic view on iPhone long term.',\n",

       "    \"Thank you. We'll take our next question from Ben Bollin with Cleveland Research.\",\n",
       "    \"Thank you for taking the question. Tim, I'm interested in how you think about the relationship between the total iOS installed base and then the subsequent performance you see within the services or the paid subscriptions. And a second part to that is, how do you look at the existing services business in terms of the growth you get from customers who are already subscribers versus completely net new or greenfield subscribers?\",\n",
       "    \"And Ben, on the services engagement and how we think about customers, right, obviously, it's important for us that customers are engaged on our services platforms. And the ones that we have, we know that the more engaged they are, they're more likely to stay with Apple for the long term. So we just obviously track all those metrics, and they're very important for us. And that's why we continue to improve the quality of our offerings and the quantity over time.\",\n",
       "    \"As you've seen, we launched a lot of new services. We obviously care a lot about new customers as well, and that's why we keep track of the installed base and a lot of other metrics on that front. It's very similar to what we do with products. I mean, also for products, we care a lot about upgraders.\",\n",
       "    \"We care a lot about switchers. It's obviously the combination of the two that when you put it together, you know, provides the level of growth that you've actually seen in our services business. I mean the last 12 months, we've done over $72 billion of revenue on services. It's the size of a Fortune 50 company.\",\n",
       "    \"It couldn't happen with our contribution from both existing and new customers.\",\n",

       "    \"Yeah, hey, guys. First of all, congratulations on stellar quarter in December and all the records that the Apple community has set. Tim, I had a question on the content on Apple TV. When we look at the Apple content that you guys put all on TV original content, it's typically very socially responsible and healthy, for example, at Ted Lasso.\",\n",
       "    'Has this, in effect, created a constraint or a hesitancy of some sort for Apple to go and purchase studios when they come up? Or have those decisions been primarily financial or otherwise?',\n",
       "    \"There's plenty to pick from out there. And I think that we're doing a pretty good job of it as we speak.\",\n",
       "    \"Fair enough. And then my follow-up was the Apple vision of healthcare in the future. So you guys have sort of cautiously approached healthcare with iWatch and iPhone. It's mostly a preventative sort of approach.\",\n",
       "    'It provides you updates. But do you see a situation down the line where Apple perhaps plays a more active role, either through the Watch or some of the device where perhaps a doctor or a hospital mandates that the watch we want for effectively for critical and vital monitoring? And I was curious if you could just give us some color on how you guys think about healthcare and iWatch in that confluence?',\n",
       "    \"My sense has always been that there's more here. I don't want to get into a road map discussion in the call. But we continue to kind of pull the string and see where it takes us. But we're really satisfied with how we're doing in this area because we are fundamentally changing people's lives and, in some cases, saving people's lives.\",\n",

A year ago, I spoke to you about the atmosphere of uncertainty in which we were living and the way it had come to define our daily experience, both as people and as a company. Today, much has changed, profoundly so.',\n",
       "    \"And while we are still living through unprecedented times, we are encouraged by progress around the world. I'm grateful to our teams who have stayed resolutely focused on our customers and the pursuit of innovation on their behalf. We've aimed to help our customers navigate the world as it is while empowering them to create the world as it can be. Whether it's public health workers managing vaccination campaigns on iPhone or students returning to classrooms full of iPads or families staying connected over face time, it is an honor to know that what we make matters and to see that reflected in the world and in our performance.\",\n",
       "    'This fiscal year, we reported $366 billion in revenue, which represents 33 percent annual growth. We also achieved more than 20 percent growth across all of our product categories and an average geographic segment. And today, Apple is reporting another very strong quarter. Demand was very robust and we set a new September quarter record of $83.4 billion, up 29 percent from last year and in line with what we discussed on our last call despite larger-than-expected supply constraints.',\n",
       "    'We estimate these constraints had around a $6 billion revenue dollar impact, driven primarily by industrywide silicon shortages and COVID-related manufacturing disruptions. Even so, we set an all-time record for Mac and quarterly records for iPhone, iPad, wearables, home, and accessories, representing 30 percent year-over-year growth in products. Our services business performed better than we expected where we had an all-time record of $18.3 billion and grew 26 percent year over year. And we set quarterly records in every geographic segment with strong double-digit growth across the board.',\n",
       "    \"During fiscal 2021, we aren't nearly one-third of our revenue from emerging markets and doubled our business in India and Vietnam. We are optimistic about the future, especially as we see strong demand for our new products. At the end of the September quarter, we introduced our iPhone 13 lineup, as well as the Apple Watch Series 7, iPad, and iPad mini, all of which represent significant advances. The iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 mini, alongside the iPhone 13 Pro and Pro Max are setting a new standard with their superfast performance, advanced camera systems, longer battery life, and brilliant, Super Retina displays.\",\n",
       "    \"Customers are loving the ninth generation iPad, which features a beautifully sharp display and twice the storage of the previous generation, as well as the new iPad mini with its ultra-portable design and impressive speed and performance. And we've been thrilled with the reviews that Apple Watch Series 7 has earned for its larger display, faster charging, and refined design. And just last week, we introduced the completely reimagined MacBook Pro, powered by the extraordinary M1 Pro and M1 Max chips. These are our most powerful notebooks ever with game-changing performance and battery life and the world's best notebook display.\",\n",
       "    \"We think customers are going to love MacBook Pro, whether they're editing video in Final Cut Pro or making music in Logic Pro and so much more. They'll be able to do things never before possible on a notebook. We also announced our all-new AirPods that feature spatial audio and industry-leading sound, longer battery life, and an all-new design. For the Home, we added three new colors to our HomePod mini lineup, which offers seamless integration across Apple's products and services.\",\n",
       "    \"We also announced a new subscription tier to Apple Music called Apple Music Voice, which offers subscribers access to the services catalog of 90 million songs, all through the power of Siri. Across the board, teams at Apple continue to drive unmatched innovation through the seamlessly integrated hardware-software experience we've long prided ourselves on. iOS 15 and iPadOS 15 have created more ways than ever to stay productive, whether choosing Focus to avoid distractions or Quick Note to capture a thought. macOS Monterey offers new ways to connect with friends and family, get more done, and work fluidly across Apple devices.\",\n",
       "    \"And watchOS 8 has made Apple Watch even more powerful and more ways than ever to stay active and to track your health on the go. We've never had a more diverse range of services for our customers to choose from and we've been very encouraged by our performance, which reflects growing customer enthusiasm and satisfaction. In just its first two years, Apple TV+ has already proved itself to fans around the world. And I want to congratulate the incredible actors, writers, storytellers, producers, and everyone else whose behind-the-scenes work has made that success possible.\",\n",
       "    \"This quarter, Apple TV+ won 11 Emmys, including the award for Outstanding Comedy Series for Ted Lasso. That show has continued to bring light and laughter to fans all over the world with its boundless optimism and beloved cast of characters. We couldn't be more proud of our entire lineup of content from the gripping second seasons of The Morning Show and Truth Be Told to our newest programs, Swagger, which is out tomorrow. The response has been incredible.\",\n",
       "    'This quarter also saw major updates to Fitness+, including the addition of new activities like meditation and Pilates and the announcement of Group Workouts, a feature that brings fitness and friends together. We also share that Fitness+ will soon be available in 15 new countries, bringing workouts for every age and skill level to millions of more people around the world.

And on Apple News, we launched a news partner program that expands Apple's support for journalism, while creating an even better business opportunity for publishers. And we continue to support our customers around the world. We're glad to report we've opened several new Apple stores.\",\n",
       "    'This quarter, we opened a beautiful store in Changsha, which is our first store in the Hunan Province of China. We also just opened our third store in Istanbul and we recently added a store in the Bronx, which means we are now in all five boroughs of New York City. All of our stores are now open worldwide and have been for seven weeks. As we enter our busiest time of year, I particularly want to share my gratitude for our retail teams.',\n",

We see education not only as a fundamental good in its own right but as a great equalizing force.

That desire to create a more just and equitable world is the guiding principle behind our racial equity and justice initiative.\",\n",

Those funds will be used in a number of ways, including the creation of a new Global Hispanic Serving Institution Equity Innovation Hub. The Hub will dramatically expand the technology and resources for students in the STEM fields. Those programs join our ever-expanding work with historically black colleges and universities, including the now 45 community coding centers and regional hubs, serving underrepresented communities across the United States.',\n",

The academy is Apple's first in the United States and is designed to help prepare students for jobs in the thriving iOS app economy, which supports more than 2.1 million jobs across all 50 states. In August, we shared our impact accelerator's first cohort of Black, Latinx, and Indigenous on businesses, whose pioneering work in green technology and clean energy serves many of the communities most impacted by climate change. More broadly, we are already carbon-neutral as a company.\",\n",
       "    \"And this quarter, we made new strides toward reaching our goal of carbon-neutrality across our entire supply chain and the lifecycle of our devices by 2030. We've made significant product advances in this area. IPad and iPad mini now come with 100 percent recycled aluminum enclosure. The antenna on iPhone 13 is made up of upcycled plastic water bottles, which marks an industry-first.\",\n",
       "    \"And as our customers are seeing when they purchase iPhone 13, we've redesigned the packaging to eliminate the outer plastic wrap, which will allow us to avoid using 600 metric tons of plastic. This brings us closer to removing all plastic in our packaging by 2025. We've also made good progress toward our goal to one day make our products without taking anything from the earth. With Apple Watch Series 7, for example, 99 percent of the rare earth elements we use are recycled.\",\n",
       "    \"Ahead of COP26, I'm also pleased to report that we have more than doubled the number of our suppliers who have committed to becoming carbon-neutral by 2030. We're very encouraged to see the growth in this area and we will continue to drive those changes in the supply chain in the months and years to come. We've never viewed our environmental work as a side project. Teams across Apple are pushing this work forward in the same spirit of innovation we bring to our products and services.\",\n",
       "    \"We are determined to be a ripple in the pond that drives a far greater change. From the pandemic to climate change to inequity and injustice. Global challenges won't abide solitary solutions and we feel a deep sense of responsibility to help. We are incredibly proud of the product lineup we have going into the holiday season and we are encouraged by the customer response we've seen.\",\n",

With that, I'll hand it over to Luca for a deeper dive on our performance this quarter. Luca?\",\n",
       "    'Thank you, Tim. Good afternoon, everyone. We are pleased to report very strong financial results for the September quarter, capping a record-setting fiscal year 2021. We set a September quarter revenue record of $83.4 billion, an increase of nearly $19 billion or 29 percent from a year ago despite larger-than-expected supply constraints.',\n",
       "    'We also reached new Q4 records in every geographic segment with strong double-digit growth in each one of them. And it was a record September quarter for both products and services. On the product side, revenue was $65.1 billion, up 30 percent over a year ago as we experienced better-than-expected demand for our products despite supply constraints that we estimated at around $6 billion. We grew in each of our product categories with an all-time record for Mac and September quarter records for iPhone, for iPad, and for wearables, home, and accessories.',\n",
       "    'This level of sales performance, combined with the unmatched loyalty of our customers and the strength of our ecosystem, drove our installed base of active devices to a new all-time record. Our services set an all-time revenue record of $18.3 billion, up 26 percent over a year ago with September quarter records in every geographic segment and in every services category. Company gross margin was 42.2 percent, down 110 basis points from last quarter due to higher costs and a different mix of products, partially offset by leverage. Products gross margin was 34.3 percent, down 170 basis points sequentially as higher cost structures were partially offset by leverage and mix.',\n",
       "    'Services gross margin was 70.5 percent, up 70 basis points sequentially, mainly due to a different mix. Net income of $20.6 billion and diluted earnings per share of $1.24 both grew over 60 percent year over year and were September quarter records. Let me get into more detail for each of our revenue categories. IPhone revenue grew 47 percent year over year and set a September quarter record of $38.9 billion despite supply constraints as customer demand was very strong.',\n",
       "    'The iPhone 12 family continued to perform very well and we are seeing enthusiastic customer response to the launch of our iPhone 13 family. We also grew double digits in each geographic segment, setting September quarter records in both developed and emerging markets. The latest survey of US consumers from 451 Research indicates iPhone customer satisfaction of 98 percent for iPhone. And our active installed base of iPhones reached a new all-time high.',\n",
       "    'For Mac, we set an all-time revenue record of $9.2 billion despite supply constraints, driven by strong demand for our M1-powered MacBook Air. In fact, our last five quarters for Mac have been the best five quarters ever for the category. iPad performance was also strong with a September quarter revenue record of $8.3 billion, up 21 percent in spite of significant supply constraints as customer demand for the iPad Pro, also powered by M1, was very strong. For both Mac and iPad, we continue to see a combination of high levels of customer satisfaction and first-time buyers.',\n",
       "    'Around half of the customers purchasing Mac and iPad during the quarter were new to that product. And in the most recent surveys of US consumers from 451 Research, customer satisfaction was 97 percent for both Mac and iPad. Our continued investment in iPad and Mac is taking computing to the next level. We have redesigned and reengineered both products to provide customers an unmatched experience, which resulted in record fiscal years for both categories.',\n",
       "    \"We are carrying this momentum also in the enterprise market. For example, SAP has already deployed Macs to tens of thousands of their employees to date. Following the launch of our new M1 MacBook Pro last week, SAP is planning to add it to the growing list of M1 Mac offerings available to their global center workforce. Another example is France's National Railway Company, SNCF, which equips all train drivers with iPads to manage their entire daily workflow and train operations, helping to lower energy and maintenance costs.\",\n",
       "    'In fact, the iPads have been so well-received that 90 percent of the drivers choose to purchase them for personal use at the end of the corporate device refresh cycle. Next, wearables, home, and accessories set a new September quarter record of $8.8 billion. We continue to improve and expand our product offerings in this category, which we believe improved the overall customer experience and showcased the integration between our products and services. Apple Watch, AirPods, and HomePod mini are powerful devices in their own right.',\n",
       "    'But paired with our other products, software, and services, they create unique experiences like switching audio seamlessly between devices on your AirPods. Turning to services. As I mentioned, we reached an all-time revenue record of $18.3 billion with all-time records for cloud services, music, video, advertising, Apple Care, and payment services, and a September quarter record for the App Store. Our continued investment and strong execution in services has helped us deliver a record $68 billion in revenue during fiscal 2021, nearly tripling this category in six years.',\n",
       "    'These impressive results reflect the positive momentum we are seeing on many fronts. First, our installed base continues to grow and reach an all-time high across each geographic segment. Next, we continue to see increased customer engagement with our services. The number of paid accounts on our digital content stores grew double digits and reached a new all-time high during the September quarter in each geographic segment.',\n",
       "    \"Also, paid subscriptions continue to show very strong growth. We now have more than 745 million paid subscriptions across the services on our platform, which is up more than 160 million from last year, and nearly five times the number of paid subscriptions we had less than five years ago. And finally, as Tim mentioned earlier, we're adding new services that we think our customers will love and we continue to improve the breadth and quality of our current services offerings. Fiscal '21 was not only a big year for services but for our entire company.\",\n",
       "    'During the past 12 months, we grew our business by 33 percent or $91 billion, reaching nearly $366 billion of revenue with record-level performance across the board. Every product category and every geographic segment set a new annual revenue record and was up at least 20 percent over fiscal 2020. Let me now turn to our cash position. We ended the quarter with $191 billion in cash plus marketable securities.',\n",
       "    'We issued $6.5 billion of new-term debt, retired $1.3 billion of term debt, and decreased commercial paper by $2 billion, leaving us with total debt of $125 billion. As a result, net cash was $66 billion at the end of the quarter as we continue to make progress toward our goal of net cash-neutral over time. As our business continues to generate very strong cash flow, we were also able to return $24 billion to shareholders during the September quarter. This included $3.6 billion in dividends and equivalents and $20 billion through open-market repurchases of 137 million Apple shares.',\n",
       "    \"We also retired an additional 5 million shares in the final settlement of our 17 ASRs. As we move ahead into the December quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Tejas referred to at the beginning of the call. Given the continued uncertainty around the world in the near term, we are not providing revenue guidance, but we are sharing some directional insights based on the assumption that the COVID-related impacts to our business do not worsen from what we are projecting today for the current quarter. As we mentioned earlier, during the September quarter, supply constraints impacted our revenue by around $6 billion.\",\n",
       "    'We estimate the impact from supply constraints will be larger during the December quarter. Despite this challenge, we are seeing high demands for our products and expect to achieve very solid year-over-year revenue growth and to set a new revenue record during the September the December quarter. We expect revenue for each product category to grow on a year-over-year basis, except for iPad, which we expect to decline year over year due to supply constraints. For services, we expect our growth rate to decelerate from the September quarter but to remain strong.',\n",
       "    'We expect gross margin to be between 41.5 percent and 42.5 percent. We expect opex to be between $12.4 billion and $12.6 billion. We expect OI and E to be around negative $50 million, excluding any potential impact from the mark-to-market of minority investments and our tax rate to be around 16 percent. Finally, today, our board of directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.22 per share of common stock payable on November 11th, 2021, to shareholders of record as of November 8, 2021.',\n",

       "    \"Thank you very much. Tim, I'm wondering, can you talk a bit more about specific supply chain issues you saw and how you've seen improvements, I think, during the current quarter? And, you know, how we should think about what products you expect to see most impacted going forward? Just any more color you can give us on what's going on out there because clearly, this is hitting everyone.\",\n",
       "    'Yeah. The first product, Shannon, that really sold on a monthly basis was iPhone. And that began to happen in the US, as an example, shortly after the subsidy kind of world changed markedly. And so, I would say that predominantly, the mode of buying an iPhone in the United States is on a monthly kind of plan today.',\n",
       "    'Great. Thank you.',\n",
       "    'Yeah.',\n",
       "    'Thanks, Shannon. Can we have the next question, please?',\n",
       "    'We will hear next from Amit Daryanani with Evercore.',\n",
       "    \"You know, Tim, I'd love to understand how do you guys come forward that this is really demand that's getting deferred versus potentially getting destroyed or going somewhere else? And if you think about the supply chain bottlenecks, you know, you were the COO, you manage a lot of the stuff. Do you feel comfortable that it sort of peaks in December and alleviates from there? Or what does that trajectory look like for improvement?\",\n",
       "    \"You know, what I feel comfortable on is I feel like we've made great progress on the COVID-related disruptions. And that happened across the month of October and we're in a materially better position today. It is difficult to predict COVID, and so I'm not going to predict where it goes. But I can just tell you that as of today, we're in a materially better position than we were in September and in the first several weeks of October.\",\n",
       "    \"But I do feel very comfortable with our operational team. I think we've got a world-class one and I'm sure they're doing everything they can do to collapse cycle times and improve yields and do all the things that you can do in addition to fundamental capacity investment to remedy the situation.\",\n",
       "    \"Obviously, from a year-over-year standpoint, it's actually a significant expansion, right? Because when you look at what we did a year ago in the December quarter, 39.8 percent. This clearly indicates a significant expansion.\",\n",
       "    'Thanks, Amit. Can we have the next question, please?',\n",
       "    \"We'll hear next from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley.\",\n",
       "    'Thank you. Given the supply chain is blurring the demand picture for iPhone 13, what data points can you share that help investors understand whether demand is tracking to a product cycle that is flat, growing, or down from the very strong iPhone 12. And maybe on that front, Luca, you can also comment on where you exited the quarter from a channel inventory standpoint for iPhone relative to a normal product cycle. And I have a follow-up.',\n",
       "    \"Yeah. Look, maybe I can take both of those. The channel inventory, as you would expect in a constrained environment, the iPhone channel inventory ended below the targeted range and is currently below it. And so, that's that.\",\n",
       "    \"And, Tim, as a follow-up. We've recently surveyed 4,000 consumers in the US and China. And the feedback is most of them don't want to pay for apps or services direct to the developer, they value the security privacy ease of transactions of the App Store. So, how do you think about balancing the regulators push for more choice with a customer base that's happy with the existing experience.\",\n",
       "    'And just as a follow-on to that, how are you and Luca thinking about the potential impact at services revenue growth rate as some of the changes to the App Store go into effect?',\n",
       "    \"Everything else is a distant second. And so, what we're doing is working to explain the decisions that we've made that are key to keeping the privacy and security there, which is to not have sideloading and not have alternate ways on the iPhone where it opens up the iPhone to unreviewed apps and also gets by the privacy restrictions that we've put on the App Store. And so, we're very, very focused in discussing the privacy and security elements of the App Store with the regulators and legislators.\",\n",
       "    'Thanks, Katy. Can we have the next question, please?',\n",
       "    \"We'll take our next question from David Vogt with UBS.\",\n",
       "    \"Great. Thank you, guys, and just two quick questions. One big picture, theoretical. So, you know, you've covered the supply chain in pretty extensive detail on the call.\",\n",
       "    \"But maybe just the bigger picture on how you're thinking about it philosophically given what you just sort of went through over the last 12 to 8 months. So, what I mean by that is there's sort of a recalibration needed or an adjustment around your supply chain philosophy, either from a partner perspective or maybe a regional perspective. And, you know, how do you think about the infrastructure and visibility to sort of rebound and sort of handle sort of these disruptions that seem to crop up from time to time? And then I have a follow-up.\",\n",
       "    \"Yeah. I don't see a fundamental error that we've made, if that's what you're picking at, in terms of creating the environment that we're in. It was created for a number of reasons. The pandemic came along.\",\n",
       "    \"And so, those things are things that we're doing. We also support the CHIPS Act and the investment there to put more investment in the ground. And so, we're spending some time advocating for the CHIPS Act as well.\",\n",
       "    \"Great and that's helpful. And I didn't mean to implicate that you guys had messed up, just maybe came off that way. And maybe just as a quick follow-up, you know, when you think about, you know, purchasing devices ratably, you touched on that earlier. But maybe can you just touch on, you know, the partnerships that you have with carriers and the support that they have given you over the last couple of years that's been a key component of your success? You know, the type of relationships that you have globally.\",\n",
       "    \"You know, do you think sort of this business model as it's currently sort of, you know, put together globally is sort of a permanent structure? Meaning, you know, carriers are going to be an integral part of driving demand for iPhones? Or, you know, is there a sense that maybe it's a little bit more transitory depending on the part of the cycle that we're in?\",\n",
       "    \"I think, that 5G has provided a once in a decade kind of upgrade potential and it's a multi-year kind of thing. It's not a one-year-and-done. And I think that we are motivated there, the carriers are motivated there. We have mutual interests and the customer benefits hugely from getting a new 5G phone that has 5G and a number of other features in it, too.\",\n",
       "    'Thank you. Can we have the next question, please?',\n",
       "    'Thank you very much.',\n",
       "    \"And so, we'll take our next question from Krish Sankar with Cowen and Company.\",\n",
       "    'Yeah. Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I have two of them too.',\n",
       "    \"And Tim, I will give you a reprieve from the supply chain questions. I have two on services. The first one is on your new ATT, the App Tracking Transparency feature. And all the headlines it has garnered recently, I'm curious, the feedback you've seen or received from the advertisers and users and how they've also impacted search ads in your own ad business.\",\n",
       "    'Give us, you know, a feedback and then I have a follow-up.',\n",
       "    \"There's no other motivation.\",\n",
       "    \"Got it, Tim. And that's a very fair characterization. Thank you for that. And then as a quick follow-up, I'm just kind of curious, you know, on the mobile gaming in your App Store, you know, there have been some recent actions by certain governments to limit game time.\",\n",
       "    \"You mean limiting the time on games? Is that what you're getting at?\",\n",
       "    'Yeah, exactly. Like in China, they have decided to limit game time. Things like that.',\n",
       "    'Thank you.',\n",
       "    'Yeah.',\n",
       "    'Thanks. Can we have the next question, please?',\n",
       "    \"Thank you. We'll take our next question from Samik Chatterjee with JP Morgan.\",\n",
       "    'Great. Hi. Thanks a lot for taking my question. I guess, Tim, I wanted to first to start off on your comment about strong demand across products.',\n",
       "    \"We've put our current thoughts in the gross margin guidance that we gave you, the 41.5 percent to 42.5 percent. I would tell you that we are seeing a significant increase in freight costs and I would assume that that is pretty consistent across different companies. And so, we're clearly seeing some inflation there.\",\n",
       "    'Thank you.',\n",
       "    'Yep.',\n",
       "    'Thanks. Can we have the next question, please?',\n",
       "    \"Thank you we'll take our next question from Jim Suva with Citigroup.\",\n",
       "    \"Thank you. And I'll ask both my questions at the same time. Probably the first one is for Tim. On the services revenue, much better than expected.\",\n",
       "    \"And so, the amount of supply is growing dramatically. It's just that the demand is so robust that we envision having supply constraints for the quarter.\",\n",
       "    \"And, Jim, on services, the 26 percent growth rate that we had was better than what we were expecting at the beginning of the quarter. And it was really across the board. It's difficult to single out the specific area because we set all-time records on cloud, we set, you know, all-time records across the board. Apple Care, music, video, advertising, payments services.\",\n",
       "    \"The App Store was a September quarter record. So, it was strong across the board. You know, when we look at the services business, we always think about some fundamental factors that allow us to have good visibility over the sustainability of the business, right? The fact that the installed base continues to grow, that's obviously a positive. The fact that the number of people that are actually paying on the platform continues to grow double digits, and so that obviously increases our opportunity.\",\n",
       "    'We, you know, we sell a lot of different services and our customers seem to really enjoy the experience that they have on the platform.',\n",
       "    'Thank you so much for the details.',\n",
       "    'Thanks. Can we have the next question, please?',\n",
       "    \"Thank you. We'll take our next question from Chris Caso with Raymond James.\",\n",
       "    \"Yes. Thank you. My first question, it's a question about your ability to recapture sales that you weren't able to fill in Q4, Q1, and Q2. And you have some experience in that from last year when the iPhone, not all the models, wanted at the same time, and some are late.\",\n",
       "    'And you did recapture some of that as you went past the holidays. Do you think that we should expect similar behavior this year? And then with that also is will all product categories behave similarly? Meaning that they are the same. Some product categories where if you missed the holidays, you just missed the sale.',\n",
       "    \"I think there are some products that people buy as gifts, that if it's not there, that it's perishable. But I think that we have a lot of products as well that people will wait for and would expect those to be captured and in a different time period. So, it's a combination for this certain quarter, the holiday quarter, I believe.\",\n",
       "    \"OK. As a follow-up, could you speak to iPhone mix? One of the things we noted is that the delivery time for all iPhones are a bit long because of the constraints. They're a bit longer on the Pro and the Max. Is that a function of supply or demand or perhaps both? And again, I would imagine you have a little better handle on that this year given that all the phones will be launched at the same time.\",\n",
       "    'OK. Thank you.',\n",
       "    'Thanks. Can we have the next question, please?',\n",
       "    \"Thank you. We'll take our next question from Harsh Kumar with Piper Sandler.\",\n",
       "    \"Yeah. Hey, guys. First of all, great job managing to this supply constraint. It's obviously affecting everybody, so congratulations.\",\n",
       "    \"And then, Tim, one for you. A strategic question. When Apple thinks about strategic areas that, as a company that went on, for example, software as high priority. But you're also one of the largest semiconductor companies if the company was stand-alone.\",\n",
       "    'So, curious about the kind of input and thinking that goes into owning some piece of technology. For example, when we survey people, they say batteries and screens are very important. So, why does an Apple, for example, what poses Apple from looking at areas like that?',\n",
       "    \"And I wouldn't want to rule anything out. It's more of whether or not we see our way clear to doing something that is materially better. We feel like we've done very well.\",\n",
       "    'Very well than others.',\n",
       "    \"We feel like we've done that in the chip area.\",\n",
       "    \"Thank you for that, Tim. And then I've got one for Luca. I want to go back to a question that Amit asked earlier in the call about gross margin. So, when I look at the September quarter, services obviously grew much faster than the product business, margin was down, and the same thing for December.\",\n",
       "    \"But I think you're effectively saying that there's a lot of new product launches. Would that not go into opex, for example, marketing, etc., as opposed to COGS? Or is there something that maybe needs to be clarified here?\",\n",

       "    \"But we shouldn't as investors think of that as something structural that you intend to use to flex, you know, demand curves more globally?\",\n",

       "    \"OK. And as a follow-up, you've introduced a lot of new services over the past few years and these have become a much more important part of the Apple Store.

Today, Apple is reporting a very strong quarter with double-digit revenue growth across our product and services categories and in every geographic segment. We set a new June quarter revenue record of $81.4 billion, up 36% from last year, and the vast majority of markets we track grew double digits, with especially strong growth in emerging markets, including India, Latin America, and Vietnam.',\n",
       "    'Total retail sales also set a June quarter record, and almost all of our retail stores have now opened their doors. This quarter saw a growing sense of optimism from consumers in the United States and around the world, driving renewed hope for a better future and for all that innovation can make possible. But as the last 18 months have demonstrated many times before, progress made is not progress guaranteed. An uneven recovery to the pandemic and a Delta variant surging in many countries around the world have shown us once again that the road to recovery will be a winding one.',\n",
       "    \"In the midst of that enduring adversity, we are especially humbled that our technology has continued to play a key role in keeping our customers connected. Just last month, it was great to be back with our teams and customers for the opening of our newest retail store in Los Angeles, Apple Tower Theatre. It was a hopeful reminder of the energy and sense of community shared spaces bring and how appreciative we all are now of the simple privilege of talking to one another face to face. As we look forward to more in-person interactions in the future, we're doubling down on innovation and doing all we can to help chart a course to a healthier and more equitable world.\",\n",
       "    \"I'll have more to say about our work in those areas a bit later on. But first, let's turn to our product and services categories. For iPhone, this quarter saw very strong double-digit growth in each geographic segment, and we continue to be heartened by our customers' response to the iPhone 12 lineup. We're only in the early innings of 5G, but already its incredible performance and speed have made a significant impact on how people can get the most out of our technology.\",\n",
       "    \"Customers love iPhone 12 for its superfast 5G speeds, A14 bionic chip, and Adobe vision camera never seen before in a phone. Users continue to rely on iPad and Mac to work, learn, create and connect. iPad had its highest June quarter in nearly a decade, while Mac set an all-time June quarter record. We've seen a great response to the new iMac and iPad Pro, both powered by the M1 chip's exceptional speed and power-efficient performance.\",\n",
       "    \"The iMac's remarkable thin design and vibrant colors have made it a favorite for users everywhere. And the iPad continues to be an incredibly versatile tool in our users' toolbox, inspiring creativity and connection and keeping us entertained and productive in equal measure. It was another very strong quarter for wearables, home, and accessories, which set a new June quarter record while helping people find more ways to stay entertained, healthy, and connected at home and on the go. Apple Watch remains a go-to choice for users to stay on top of their health and reach their fitness goals.\",\n",
       "    \"And our newest accessory AirTag began shipping to an enthusiastic response from customers, making the Find My network more useful than ever while protecting user privacy. Turning to services, which set a new all-time revenue record as we continue to roll out innovative new features and programming. We're proud to be the recipients of 35 Emmy nominations this year, which speaks to the quality of our programming and an enthusiastic reception from customers and critics alike. Apple TV+ users are loving series like Mythic Quest and anticipating groundbreaking films like CODA, which premieres next month.\",\n",
       "    'And of course, Ted Lasso kicked off season two just last week and continues to win over viewers with its heartwarming message about the power of community, compassion, and hope. We also introduced Apple Podcasts subscriptions, a global marketplace for users to discover exclusive content and support their favorite creators. And we launched spatial audio for Apple Music, a cinematic listening experience that promises to change how music fans listen and musicians create even more immersive, layered, and beautiful songs. Last month, we shared many exciting new features at WWDC, but more powerful than any of them was the incredible showing of developers from all walks of life and around the world.',\n",
       "    \"Much like the developer community, we are diehard optimists about technology's potential to help people live happier, healthier, and more fulfilled lives, goals that shine through with powerful new updates coming to iOS, iPadOS, macOS, and watchOS this fall. That begins with innovative new features that help users stay connected with one another, like SharePlay and spatial audio for FaceTime or disconnect when they need a break, like Focus, which limits distracting notifications when you're winding down for bed or concentrating at work. And new productivity features make iPad an even more useful tool for multitasking, helping users navigate across apps, split their screen, or use Quick Note to capture a thought the moment inspiration strives. In the health space, our new health sharing feature will make it easier than ever to securely share your health data with loved ones.\",\n",
       "    \"That includes new capabilities like walking steadiness, which uses sensors to assess user stability doing everyday task and recommends exercises to improve stability and avoid a fall. In the belief that privacy is a fundamental human right, we shared new features in iOS 15 that continue to drive our progress forward from mail privacy protection, which stops invisible pixels and an email from tracking your mail activity, to app privacy report, which helps users check on the apps they've granted permission to use their personal data. We also introduced some incredible next-generation technologies coming to the accessibility space, from assistive touch, which helps people with limb differences navigate Apple Watch to new voiceover capabilities to help blind and low-vision users. Accessibility remains a bedrock principle for us in the simple belief that the best technology for the world should be the best technology for everyone.\",\n",
       "    \"But the responsibility to be a force for good in the lives of others extends beyond the technology we make, so to the teachers and students shaping our future. This quarter, as part of our Racial Equity and Justice Initiative, we awarded innovation grants to engineering schools at four historically black colleges and universities to expand their coursework, scholarships, and internship opportunities in hardware engineering and silicon chip design. We see education as a great equalizing force, and we're more dedicated than ever to supporting the educators, advocates, and students lighting the path and leading the way. That includes the 350 Swift Student Challenge winners we recognized at this year's WWDC.\",\n",

Young people's innovations remind us that our collective future is bound up in the next generation's passion for solving global challenges and of the responsibility we have to join them in building a better world. Turning to our own backyard, we're continuing to press forward in our efforts to help bring more affordable housing to the Bay Area and across California. This month, we shared that we've contributed more than $1 billion to help first-time homeowners and construct thousands of new affordable housing units across the state.\",\n",
       "    \"And we're continuing to stay focused on supporting the global response to the pandemic and delivering the best products and services for people. Our greatest source of inspiration isn't technology itself but how people use it in their own lives in ways great and small: to write a novel or to read one; to care for an ailing patient or see a doctor virtually; to track their heart rate on a jog or to train for the Olympics. Every day, I'm grateful for the dedication of our teams to the simple mission of creating technology that improves people's lives.

We are very pleased to report record June quarter financial results, which reflect the importance of our products and services in our customers' lives and our strong underlying operating performance. Our revenue reached a June quarter record of $81.4 billion, an increase of nearly $22 billion or 36% from a year ago.\",\n",

We also set new June quarter records in every geographic segment with very strong double-digit growth in each one of them. Products revenue was a June quarter record of $63.9 billion, up 37% over a year ago. This level of sales performance, combined with the unmatched loyalty of our customers, drove our installed base of active devices to a new all-time record.',\n",
       "    'Our services set an all-time revenue record of $17.5 billion, up 33% over a year ago with June quarter records in each geographic segment. Company gross margin was 43.3%, up 80 basis points from last quarter, driven by cost savings and a higher mix of services, partially offset by seasonal loss of leverage. Products gross margin was 36%, down 10 basis points sequentially, as seasonal loss of leverage was almost entirely offset by cost savings. Services gross margin was 69.8%, down 30 basis points sequentially, mainly due to a different mix.',\n",
       "    'Net income of $21.7 billion, diluted earnings per share of $1.30, and operating cash flow of $21.1 billion were all June quarter records by a wide margin. Let me get into more detail for each of our revenue categories. iPhone revenue set a June quarter record of $39.6 billion, growing 50% year over year and exceeding our own expectations as the iPhone 12 family continues to be in very high demand. Performance was consistently strong across the world, and we grew very strong double digits in each geographic segment, setting June quarter records in most markets we track.',\n",
       "    'Our active installed base of iPhones reached a new all-time high thanks to the exceptional loyalty of our customer base and the strength of our ecosystem. In the U.S., the latest survey of consumers from 451 Research indicates iPhone customer satisfaction of 97% for the iPhone 12 family. Turning to services. As I mentioned, we reached an all-time revenue record of $17.5 billion with all-time records for cloud services, music, video, advertising, and payment services and June quarter records for the App Store and AppleCare.',\n",
       "    'Our newer service offerings, Apple TV+, Apple Arcade, Apple News+, Apple Card, Apple Fitness+ as well as the Apple One bundle, continue to scale across users, content, and features and are contributing to overall services growth. The key drivers for our services business all continue to move in the right direction. First, our installed base of devices reached an all-time high across each geographic segment. Second, the number of both transacting and paid accounts on our digital content stores reached a new all-time high during the June quarter in each geographic segment, and paid accounts increased double digits.',\n",

We now have more than 700 million paid subscriptions across the services on our platform, which is up more than 150 million from last year and nearly four times the number of paid subscriptions we had only four years ago. And finally, we're adding new services that we think our customers will love while also continuing to improve the breadth and quality of our current services offerings. For example, during WWDC in June, we previewed our new iCloud+ and Apple Wallet features, which we believe will create a more secure and differentiated customer experience.\",\n",

This quarter, we began shipping our new Apple TV 4K with a redesigned Siri Remote and our brand-new AirTags, and the customer response to both products has been very strong. In addition to its outstanding sales performance globally, Apple Watch continues to extend its reach, with nearly 75% of the customers purchasing Apple Watch during the quarter being new to the product.',\n",
       "    'For Mac, despite supply constraints, we set a June quarter record of $8.2 billion, up 16% over last year, with June quarter revenue records in most markets we track around the world. It is remarkable that the last four quarters for Mac have been its best four quarters ever. This exceptional level of sales success has been driven by the very enthusiastic customer response to our new Macs powered by the M1 chip, which we most recently brought to our newly redesigned iMac. iPad performance was also strong with revenue of $7.4 billion, up 12% in spite of significant supply constraints.',\n",
       "    \"During the quarter, we also starting shipping our new iPad Pro powered by the M1 chip, and customer response has been outstanding. Both iPad and Mac have taken computing to the next level, and when you combine their performance over the last 12 months, they are now the size of a Fortune 50 business thanks to the best product lineups we've ever had, very high levels of customer satisfaction and a loyal growing installed base. In fact, around half of the customers purchasing Mac and iPad during the quarter were new to that product, and in most recent surveys of U.S. consumers from 451 Research, customer satisfaction was 92% for Mac and 95% for iPad.\",\n",
       "    \"In enterprise, our customers are excited about the superior performance, battery life, and security that the new M1 Macs bring. MassMutual, for example, is offering M1 MacBook Pro to all of its employees and equipping all conference rooms with M1 Mac Minis in preparation for return to work. And with its incredible performance and affordable entry price, the MacBook Air with M1 is gaining rapid adoption among many leading enterprise organizations. Italgas, Italy's largest natural gas company, which will soon be using its extensive network to distribute renewable gases, is replacing every employee's Windows laptop with the new MacBook Air powered by Apple's M1 chip to bring the latest technology to its workforce.\",\n",
       "    \"And Grab, Southeast Asia's leading super app that provides transportation, food delivery and digital payment services, is adding M1 MacBook Air to its companywide M1 Mac deployment. Let me now turn to our cash position. We ended the quarter with $194 billion in cash plus marketable securities. We retired $3 billion of term debt and increased commercial paper by $3 billion, leaving us with total debt of $122 billion.\",\n",
       "    'As a result, net cash was $72 billion at the end of the quarter. As our business continued to perform at a very high level, we are also able to return $29 billion to shareholders during the June quarter. This included $3.8 billion in dividends and equivalents and $17.5 billion through open market repurchases of 136 million Apple shares. We also began a $5 billion accelerated share repurchase program in May, resulting in the initial delivery and retirement of 32 million shares.',\n",
       "    \"As we move ahead into the September quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Tejas referred to at the beginning of the call. Given the continued uncertainty around the world in the near term, we are not providing revenue guidance, but we are sharing some directional insights assuming that the COVID-related impacts to our business do not worsen from what we are projecting today for the current quarter. We expect very strong double-digit year-over-year revenue growth during the September quarter. We expect revenue growth to be lower than our June quarter year-over-year growth of 36% for three reasons.\",\n",
       "    'First, we expect the foreign exchange impact on our year-over-year growth rate to be three points less favorable than it was during the June quarter. Second, we expect our services growth rate to return to a more typical level. The growth rate during the June quarter benefited from a favorable compare as certain services were significantly impacted by the COVID lockdowns a year ago. And third, we expect supply constraints during the September quarter to be greater than what we experienced during the June quarter.',\n",
       "    'The constraints will primarily impact iPhone and iPad. We expect gross margin to be between 41.5% and 42.5%. We expect opex to be between $11.3 billion and $11.5 billion. We expect OI&E to be around zero, excluding any potential impact from the mark-to-market of minority investments and our tax rate to be around 16%.',\n",
       "    \"Finally, today, our board of directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.22 per share of common stock payable on August 12, 2021, to shareholders of record as of August 9, 2021. With that, let's open the call to questions.\",\n",

       "    'Yes. Thank you. Good morning. Just to dig into the commentary on guidance a little bit.',\n",
       "    \"Just starting with the fact that last year, obviously, there was a later launch of iPhone than we've typically seen in other years. Could you talk us through that and perhaps some of the other products, what may be different as compared to last year?\",\n",
       "    \"The first factor is that the dollar continues to be favorable on a year-over-year basis in the sense that it's weakened against most currencies on a year-over-year basis, but that benefit is going to be about three points less in the September quarter than what we've experienced during the June quarter because the dollar strengthened against most currencies in recent weeks. Second, I mentioned that the services growth rate that we've experienced in the June quarter, 33%, that's significantly higher than what we've had in recent history. And that was due to the fact that there were a couple of services categories, namely our advertising business and AppleCare that were significantly impacted a year ago because of the COVID lockdowns, and therefore, they had a relatively easy compare in the June quarter. And so we don't expect that to continue into the September quarter.\",\n",
       "    'And so we came in at a number that was slightly below the low end of that range that we had quoted at the beginning of the quarter, but we expect that number to be higher for the September quarter. And so when you put all that together, again, very strong double-digit growth for September, with these caveats that I just mentioned.',\n",
       "    'If I could follow up with regard to the supply constraints, and do you expect those supply constraints to persist through the December quarter as well what effect will that have on the holiday selling season? And then in conjunction with that, what additional costs are you absorbing because of these supply constraints? Is that having an effect on gross margins or just product cost in general as you perhaps pay a little more to get more supply?',\n",
       "    \"Chris, it's Tim. In terms of the cost, we're paying more for freight than I would like to pay, but component costs continue in the aggregate to decline. In terms of supply constraints and how long they will last, I don't want to predict that today. We're going to take it sort of one quarter at a time.\",\n",
       "    \"And as you would guess, we'll do everything we can to mitigate whatever set of circumstances we're dealt.\",\n",
       "    \"And, Chris, on the cost side, as I mentioned during my comments, our results for gross margins for the June quarter, 43.3%, we really saw some really nice cost savings during the quarter. And I think you've seen that we provided guidance of 41.5% to 42.5% for September, which is obviously a level that we are very pleased with.\",\n",
       "    'Right. Thank you.',\n",
       "    'Thank you, Chris. Can we have the next questions, please?',\n",

       "    \"Thank you very much, and congratulations to you and your global team for great operations during a challenging time. Tim and Luca, I just have one question and either of you or both of you could figure out who's best to answer it. But we look at a world of pretty unprecedented, whether it be COVID, the Delta variant, China flood, supply chain components, just wondering for your like R&D and innovation, is it being materially impacted by that such where a normal cadence is unfair? Or is it kind of happening during a slow time of year where you're able to empower people to work remotely and still have the typical innovations and product launches that you've had historically in the past?\",\n",
       "    \"And so I'm very pleased with it.\",\n",

       "    \"Thank you very much. Tim, I'm curious, what have you learned from this iPhone cycle regarding customer preferences and pricing and maybe subscriptions in that? And if there is a difference, if you could talk about it on a geographic basis. Thanks.\",\n",
       "    \"It was an incredibly strong quarter. It set a June quarter revenue record for Greater China for us, and so we're very proud of that and doing the best job we can to serve customers there. We had a particularly strong response to the 12 Pro and the 12 Pro Max. Those results were particularly strong.\",\n",
       "    'For the Apple Watch, that number was 85%. And so we could not be happier with the results.',\n",
       "    'Was the 85% China or overall?',\n",
       "    '85% was China. Yes. I was talking about, specifically, the numbers I referenced were specifically for China.',\n",
       "    'And then, Shannon, for the world, the Watch is 75%.',\n",
       "    'Right. Great. Thank you so much.',\n",
       "    'Yes. Thanks, Shannan. Can we have the next question, please?',\n",
       "    \"Thank you. We'll take our next question from Amit Daryanani with Evercore. Please go ahead.\",\n",
       "    'Perfect. Thanks a lot for taking my question. I have two as well. I guess, first off, Luca, I was hoping you could maybe talk a little bit more about the gross margins and maybe the expectations you laid out for September.',\n",
       "    \"I think sequentially, it implies it's down a hundred basis points or so. So maybe just touch on what are the puts and takes there would be helpful because I think historically, September tends to be flattish, maybe even up a little bit gross margin number for you folks.\",\n",
       "    \"Yes. I think it's important to go back to the Q3 results. Right? It's 43.3%. And one of the things that I mentioned is that in addition to getting really good cost savings on a sequential basis, we also had a very high mix of services as part of the total, and particularly, with advertising doing really, really well because of the rebound that we saw from the COVID lockdowns a year ago.\",\n",
       "    \"And so as we move forward sequentially, we do expect a different mix, and so that drives the guidance that we provided, which, again, as you know, it's significantly higher than just a year ago. For example, a year ago, we were at 38.2%, so almost 400 basis points of expansion on a year-over-year basis. Right? And so I think it's important to take that into account, just a different mix.\",\n",
       "    \"Got it. No. Absolutely. I don't think anyone expected gross margins to be north of 40% just quickly for you, folks.\",\n",
       "    \"So that is impressive. If I could follow up on Services, and I know you called out the 33% growth this quarter as a bit of an aberration. The compares were easier. But as you look at your services growth rate over the last four quarters, let's just say, what do you think is enabling this growth? Is it you're able to have a higher ARPU more monetization of your installed base? Or is your installed base growing? I'm curious, which one is bigger? And then over time, how do you think those two components stack up for you?\",\n",
       "    \"It's a combination of multiple factors. Right? Obviously, the fact that our installed base continues to grow and it sets new all-time highs all the time obviously gives us a larger opportunity all the time. And second, we have more and more people that are engaged in our ecosystem, both transacting for free, which is a very large number, and people that are willing to pay for some of the services, and that percentage of people that are paying for our services continues to grow nicely. I mentioned it grew double digits again this quarter.\",\n",
       "    \"And so all that additional revenue helps, and I think it flows through our growth rates. As you said, during the last four quarters, we are well into the mid-20s. Right? So I think it's obviously very nice for us to see.\",\n",
       "    'Perfect. Thank you.',\n",
       "    'Thanks, Amit. Can we have the next question, please?',\n",
       "    \"Thank you. We'll hear next from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\",\n",
       "    'Thank you. Good afternoon. Can you hear me OK?',\n",
       "    'Yes. We can.',\n",
       "    \"OK. Good. So first question, there's a debate in the market around how much Apple benefited from the pandemic, given increased spend in areas like Mac and App Store. But of course, you've mentioned over the past several quarters that there are other areas that were limited by the pandemic and store closures, and less foot traffic.\",\n",
       "    'When you net out all the puts and takes, was your business helped? Or was it hindered by the pandemic?',\n",
       "    \"And now some of these businesses are rebounding. I mentioned advertising and AppleCare. iPad and Mac, it's difficult for us to gauge because we've been constrained for quite a long period of time. And the reality is that maybe the new normal after we exit COVID may be different from the past.\",\n",
       "    \"And just a follow-up on iPhone specifically. If you look historically after a really strong product cycle, which you've experienced this year with iPhone 12, iPhone revenues come under pressure because the upgrade rate slows, the mix often shifts to the lower end of the portfolio. Is it fair to assume a similar trend will play out over the next year? Or if not, what do you think is different this time?\",\n",
       "    'And in the U.S., we had the top three selling models. In the U.K., we have four out of the top five. In Australia, we have the top two. In Japan, we have the top three.',\n",
       "    'In Urban China, we have the top two. And so the response from customers all around have been great. Obviously, the product itself is amazing. The 12 lineup was a huge leap that introduced 5G and had A14 Bionic and a number of other fantastic features that customers love.',\n",
       "    \"The next thing I think to consider is that we're in the very early innings of 5G. If you look at 5G penetration around the world, there's only a couple of countries that are in the double-digits yet. And so that's an amazing thing nine months or so into this. And the last thing is we're going to continue to deliver great products.\",\n",
       "    \"We're going to continue to do what we do best is integrate hardware, software, and services together into an amazing experience. And so those are the things that I would consider if I were coming up with forecast.\",\n",
       "    \"That's great color. Thank you.\",\n",
       "    'Thanks, Katy. Can we have the next question, please?',\n",
       "    \"We'll take our next question from Harsh Kumar with Piper Sandler.\",\n",
       "    'Yes. Hey, guys. First of all, congratulations. Fantastic execution.',\n",
       "    \"It's resulted in consistency for your results. Tim, this is actually perfect timing for this question. You talked about your installed base of a billion-odd units. I was curious if you could help us understand how old that installed base is.\",\n",
       "    \"And the reason that I'm asking this question is we're clearly seeing people upgrade to 5G phones. And if that's the case and that continues, that could be a larger force than most other forces for your revenues to continue to grow as people migrate to the 5G family of phones. So I was curious if you could shed light on how the upgrades are happening and then also how old that base is.\",\n",
       "    \"And we feel really great about the momentum. But at the same time, we recognize that the 5G penetration is quite low around the world and very, very low. We're at the front end of this.\",\n",
       "    \"Well, I think that that acquisition has lots of questions that people are asking, and I'll sort of leave that up to everyone else. And in terms of us and how we decide to make silicon, we ask ourselves if we can do something better, if we can deliver a better product, if we can buy something in the market and it's great and it's as good as what we could do, we're going to buy it. We'll only enter where we believe we have an ability to do something better and therefore, make a better product for the user. And so the M1 is a great example of that.\",\n",
       "    \"We have the ability within our silicon team to deliver a product that we feel is appreciably better than we could buy. And so we've taken our great hardware and software expertise and combine those and have brought the M1 out. And the response to the M1 has been unbelievable. It's powering Mac sales that are constrained.\",\n",
       "    \"It's powering now iPad, which also has constraints on it. And so that's how we look at whether we should enter a market or not.\",\n",
       "    'Thank you.',\n",
       "    'Thanks for the question.',\n",
       "    'Thank you. Can we have the next question, please?',\n",
       "    'Certainly. We will take our next question from Krish Sankar with Cowen and Company. Please go ahead.',\n",
       "    'Yes. Hi. Thanks for taking my question, and congrats on the strong results. First one for Luca, you mentioned Services growth should normalize in the September quarter.',\n",
       "    'And I understand the last few quarters, Services business was strong, driven by work from home, etc. So what is the normalized growth rate for the Services business as folks return back to the office in this post-COVID world? And then I have a follow-up.',\n",
       "    \"Well, I think you can go back several quarters and try to do a bit of an average, and that's what we were talking about. Of course, there's always a bit of variability around results. Right? But certainly, we haven't done 33% in years. And so that was a bit of an anomaly.\",\n",
       "    \"And, again, I explained it's around a couple of the businesses that had a relatively easy compare during the June quarter. So our services growth has been for many, many quarters in strong double digits, and we feel confident around that level.\",\n",
       "    \"Got it. Got it. And then just a follow-up for Tim or Luca. I think, Tim, you mentioned in your prepared comments that in September quarter, there's going to be greater impact on supply constraints on the iPhone and iPad.\",\n",
       "    \"So I'm kind of curious, this is the first time I heard you talk about component shortages impacting the iPhone. Can you be more specific? Is it display drivers? Or what exactly is the chokepoint on the supply?\",\n",
       "    'As I said before, I think probably maybe with the basis of your question, the sort of the latest nodes, which we use in several of our products have not been as much of an issue. The legacy nodes are where the supply constraints have been on silicon.',\n",
       "    'Thanks, Tim.',\n",
       "    'Yes.',\n",
       "    'Thanks, Krish. Can we have the next question, please?',\n",
       "    \"Thank you. We'll hear our next question from David Vogt with UBS.\",\n",
       "    'Great. Thank you, guys, for the question. So maybe just a point of clarification. So based on the data and the comments about upgraders and switchers being strong as well as emerging markets were relatively strong in the quarter, what does that specific set of data point strength mean for the iPhone portfolio? And I guess my question around that is, when you think about switchers and price points, I think last year you launched the SE too to really address maybe some of the lower price point markets like the emerging markets.',\n",
       "    'So does that mean, thinking about the portfolio going forward, there is less of a need for a lower price product going forward? And that the current portfolio and the new cycle going forward would be more high end in nature as we currently have today? And then I have a follow-up.',\n",
       "    'Yes, David. We had an incredible quarter for the emerging markets. In Q3, we set June quarter records in Mexico and Brazil and Chile, in Turkey and UAE, in Poland and Czech Republic, India, obviously, in China, as I talked about before, Thailand, Malaysia, Vietnam, Cambodia, Indonesia. I could go on and name a few more.',\n",
       "    \"And so I'm pleased with how all of them are doing. And I think we need sort of that range of price points to accommodate the types of people that we want to accommodate. And so we've put something for the entry buyer who really wants to get into an iPhone and then something for the pro buyer who wants the very best iPhone that they can buy. And I think that's true in the emerging markets as good as it's true in the United States or other developed markets.\",\n",
       "    \"No. No. That's helpful. I appreciate that, Tim.\",\n",
       "    \"So does that mean sort of the emerging market buyer that wants to get into the iPhone is looking for a device that has 5G capability as well? Obviously, we're early innings in a lot of markets. Or how do we think about that over the intermediate to longer term in terms of the consumer preference for 5G in those markets if available from an infrastructure perspective?\",\n",
       "    'Great. Thank you very much.',\n",
       "    'Yes.',\n",
       "    'Thank you. Can we have the next question, please?',\n",
       "    \"Thank you. We'll take our next question from Ben Bollin with Cleveland Research Company.\",\n",
       "    \"Good evening, everyone. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to start, Luca or Tim, could you walk us through a little bit about how you think Apple One bundles are influencing the trajectory of services and the economics? And then a second part on services, I'm curious how you think IDFA is developing and influencing the trajectory of the advertising business within Services.\",\n",
       "    \"In terms of Apple One, as you know, we're offering Apple One because it makes enjoying our subscription services easier than ever before, including Apple Music and Apple TV+ and Apple Arcade and iCloud and more. And so we really put the customer at the center of that and have recently began to remind people about Apple One in a way that we probably waited a few months before doing that. And so I'm very pleased with what we're seeing on Apple One right now and think it's a great ramp for the future of services. And more importantly, it's a great customer benefit because many of our customers like to try out more than one of these services, and it allows them to do that with one easy bundle and subscription service.\",\n",
       "    \"In terms of IDFA or the advertising in general, I take it your question is about ATT. With ATT, we've been getting quite a bit of customer reaction, positive reaction to being able to make the decision on a transparent basis about whether to be tracked or not. And it seems to be going very well from a user point of view.\",\n",

       "    'Yes. Thank you. I have two as well. To begin with, Luca, you noted significant product revenue deleverage, but yet your product gross margins were roughly flat.',\n",
       "    'You noted cost savings. Can you maybe talk about whether these are tactical in nature or more structural like vertical integration that will continue to drive benefits to product gross margins? And on services side, you noted several times about the strength in ad growth, which is obviously very high-margin contributor, but the sequential trajectory on services margins was flat. So what were some of the offsets there? And then I have a follow-up for Tim.',\n",
       "    \"Yes. On the product side, I talked about cost savings. Tim mentioned that maybe on the freight side, we're seeing some level of cost pressure that is a bit out of the norm at this point in the cycle. For everything else for all the major commodities and components, we continue to see a very typical cycle where we are getting good cost savings on a sequential basis.\",\n",
       "    \"And so far, it's been very good, as you can tell from the absolute level of gross margins because on the product side, we are up more than 600 basis points on a year-over-year basis. So it feels like something that we've been able to accomplish and we're able to maintain, at least in the near term. Nothing that was abnormal during the quarter or a one-off in nature. It was pretty structural.\",\n",
       "    'On the services side, again, up a lot on a year-over-year basis. So the baseline has gone up a lot. The sequential decline, as you said, it was very, very small. And as I mentioned several times in the past, we have a very large services portfolio with very different margin profiles in our services.',\n",
       "    \"We're very, very, very happy with where we are with the services margin trajectory.\",\n",
       "    \"Well, for the quarter, as you can see, we grew 58%. So it was a strong quarter, and embedded in that was a quarterly record for Services, which includes the App Store. And so we're seeing strength in China. The economy has really bounced back there fairly quickly from COVID.\",\n",

       "    \"Apple assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements or information which speak as of their respective dates. I'd now like to turn over the call to Tim for introductory remarks.\",\n",
       "    'Thanks, Tejas. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining the call today. Apple is proud to report another strong quarter, one where we set new March quarter records for both revenue and earnings, besting our year ago revenue performance by 54%. Reflecting both the enduring ways our products have helped our users meet this moment in their own lives, as well as the optimism consumers seem to feel about better days ahead, we set new March quarter records in every geographic segment, and success was broadly distributed across our product categories.',\n",
       "    \"Mac and services delivered all-time record results, and we set new March quarter records for iPhone and wearables, home and accessories. To provide some color on our results, let's turn to our product categories. We saw a very strong performance for iPhone, which grew 66% year over year, driven by the strong popularity of the iPhone 12 family. With unmatched 5G capability, the best camera system ever in an iPhone and advanced durability from Ceramic Shield, this family of devices is popular with both upgraders and new customers alike.\",\n",
       "    'And just last week, we unveiled an all-new purple finish for iPhone 12 and 12 Mini. As has been the case throughout the pandemic, iPad and Mac continue to be critically important tools for our customers. Over the past year, tens of millions of iPads and Macs have been deployed to help students learn, creators create and to enhance remote work in all of its forms. This has helped iPad grow very strong double digits to its highest March quarter revenue in nearly a decade.',\n",
       "    \"On Mac, fueled by the M1, we set an all-time revenue record continuing the momentum for the product category. In fact, the last three quarters for Mac have been its three best quarters ever. Last week, both iPad and Mac took a big step forward. We debuted a radically redesigned brand-new iMac designed around M1's unmatched capabilities, and we've brought M1 to iPad for the first time in the new iPad Pro with 5G capability and a Liquid Retina XDR display.\",\n",
       "    \"It was a quarter of sustained strength for wearables, home and accessories, which grew by 25% year over year. Apple Watch is a global success story, and the category set March quarter records in each geographic segment, thanks to strong performance from both Apple Watch Series 6 and Apple Watch SE. It's an exciting and busy period ahead for wearables, home and accessories with the launch of the next-generation Apple TV 4K and our newest accessory, AirTag. AirTag builds on the powerful and incredibly useful Find My experience, helping users privately and securely keep track of the items that matter most to them.\",\n",
       "    \"Third-party accessories and products can also make use of the find my network, guaranteeing a great experience no matter what products you choose to use. Turning to services. We achieved growth of 27% year over year and set new records for services in each of our geographic segments. We continue to enhance and improve our current service offerings from Apple Music to Apple News while continuing to launch new services that enhance our customers' lives.\",\n",
       "    \"Just last week, we introduced Apple Card Family which reinvents how you can share credit cards and build credit together. We also announced Apple Podcast subscriptions, a global marketplace for listeners to discover premium content from their favorite creators and storytellers. While we're on the topic of services, in many ways, this quarter showed the unique value to customers created by Apple's belief in the deep integration of hardware, software and services. Across our products and throughout our software ecosystem, we continue to deploy industry-leading new tools to protect users' fundamental right to privacy.\",\n",
       "    \"In addition to the App Store privacy nutrition labels that we discussed on last quarter's call, we're proud to have launched the full implementation of App Tracking Transparency. This powerful yet simple idea gives users a choice over how their data is used and shared across the apps that they love and use every day. No matter what device you enjoy it from, it is a milestone period for Apple TV+, racking up many new award nominations and wins, including its first Oscar nominations. Ted Lasso, in particular, has been recognized with a multitude of awards and nominations including most recently, an AFI Program of the Year Recognition, Writers Guild of America Awards and a clean sweep at the Critics Choice Awards.\",\n",
       "    \"Apple TV+ also continues to be a place where we can tell stories that matter and lift up important voices and experiences like our new upcoming content partnership with Malala, or our latest original documentary special, The Year the Earth Changed, narrated by the legendary David Attenborough and released to commemorate Earth Day. This is, of course, just one example of how Apple lives its values and operationalizes the idea that to whom much is given, much is expected. To begin with our environmental efforts, just last week, we marked a milestone Earth Day on multiple fronts. In addition to the progress we've made in our own efforts to achieve our pledge of a net zero carbon footprint by 2030 across our entire supply chain and use of our products, we're proud to play a role in the growing ripple change taking place across the private sector.\",\n",
       "    \"As of this month, 110 of our suppliers have joined us in our renewable energy commitment, and we will bring online nearly 8 gigawatts of new clean energy, the equivalent of taking 3.4 million gas-powered vehicles off the road each year. Through Apple's $4.7 billion in green bonds and related efforts, we've supported transformative environmental projects around the world from clean energy initiatives in China to two of the world's largest onshore wind turbines in Denmark to 180-acre solar project outside Reno, Nevada and many more. We're also keenly focused on how this wave of green innovation can lead to equitably shared prosperity. Through our new $200 million Restore Fund, we're helping local and rural communities around the world build sustainable industries around work in forests, creating opportunities and removing up to 1 million metric tons of carbon from the atmosphere every year.\",\n",
       "    \"We were proud to announce that we have expanded and accelerated our commitment to the US economy. Over the next five years, we will invest $430 billion, creating 20,000 jobs in the process. The investments will support American innovation and drive economic benefits in every state, including a new North Carolina campus and job creating investments in innovative fields like silicon engineering and 5G technology. Looking forward, whether you're running a business or just hoping to see family again after more than a year, it's tempting at this moment to let hope about the end of the COVID-19 pandemic outstrip clear-eyed realism about the challenges we still face.\",\n",
       "    'In many places around the world, new waves of infections driven by even more infectious variants of the virus are driving new lockdowns. Instead of simply assuming that the end is in sight, we at Apple are doing our part to make it a reality, beginning with an enduring and uncompromising commitment to the health and safety of our teams, and extending well beyond our walls into the communities where we work. We also want to do everything we can to connect users to life-saving vaccinations that are in ever greater supply. Through Apple Maps, for example, we now showcase vaccine site locations here in the United States, building on our maps of testing locations in many countries around the world.',\n",
       "    \"It's worth remembering for much more than financial reasons or year-ago compares, just how we felt at this time last year when everything we knew had to change: Planes sat grounded, entire business districts were empty and silent; people left groceries or care packages sitting in the garage or in the hall overnight in recognition of all that we didn't know and therefore, had to imagine. Thanks to researchers and scientists, doctors and nurses, everyone who can put a shot in an arm and even just check a name off a list, we have reached new days of hopeful resolve. Our work is not done, but as I said a year ago, while we can't say for sure how many chapters are in this book, we can have confidence that the ending will be a good one. With that, I'll hand things over to Luca.\",\n",
       "    \"Thank you, Tim. Good afternoon, everyone. We are extremely pleased to report record results for our March quarter despite continued uncertainty in the macro environment. We've been operating in new ways for over a year, and we could not be more proud of the way our team continues to execute and innovate at unprecedented levels.\",\n",
       "    'Our revenue reached a March quarter record of $89.6 billion an increase of over $31 billion or 54% from a year ago. We grew very strong double digits in each of our product categories, with all-time records for Mac and for services and March quarter records for iPhone and for wearables, home and accessories. We also set new March quarter records in every geographic segment with growth of at least 35% in each one of them. Products revenue was a March quarter record of $72.7 billion, up 62% over a year ago.',\n",
       "    'As a result of this level of sales performance and the unmatched loyalty of our customers, our installed base of active devices reached a new all-time record in each of our major product categories. Our services set an all-time record of $16.9 billion, growing 27% over a year ago. We established new records in each geographic segment and in most service categories. I will provide more details about the performance of our services business later.',\n",
       "    'Company gross margin was 42.5%, up 270 basis points from last quarter driven by cost savings, a strong mix and favorable foreign exchange. Products gross margin was 36.1%, growing 100 basis points sequentially also thanks to cost savings and FX, partially offset by seasonal loss of leverage. Services gross margin was 70.1%, up 170 basis points sequentially and mainly due to a different mix. Net income of $23.6 billion, diluted earnings per share of $1.40 and operating cash flow of $24 billion were all March quarter records by a wide margin.',\n",
       "    'Let me get into more detail for each of our revenue categories. iPhone revenues had a March quarter record of $47.9 billion, growing 66% year over year as the iPhone 12 family continued to be in high demand. Performance was consistently strong across the world as we grew strong double digits in each geographic segment and set March quarter records in most markets we track. Thanks to the exceptional loyalty of our customer base and strength of our ecosystem, our active installed base of iPhones reached a new all-time high.',\n",
       "    'In the US, the latest survey of consumers from 451 Research indicates customer satisfaction of over 99% for the iPhone 12 family. Turning to services. We reached an all-time revenue record of $16.9 billion with all-time records for the App Store, cloud services, music, video, advertising and payment services. Our new service offerings, Apple TV+, Apple Arcade, Apple News+, Apple Card, Apple Fitness+, as well as the Apple One bundle, continue to scale across users, content and features and are contributing to overall services growth.',\n",
       "    'The key drivers for our services business all continue to move in the right direction. First, our installed base growth has accelerated and reach an all-time high across each major product category. Second, the number of both transacting and paid accounts on our digital content stores reached a new all-time high during the March quarter, with paid accounts increasing double digits in each of our geographic segments. Third, paid subscriptions continued to show strong growth.',\n",
       "    \"During the March quarter, we added more than 40 million paid subs sequentially, and we have now reached more than 660 million paid subscriptions across the services on our platform. This is up 145 million from just a year ago and twice the number of paid subscriptions we had only two and a half years ago. Finally, we're adding new services that we think our customers will love, while also continuing to improve the breadth and quality of our current service offerings. For example, Apple Arcade launched its biggest expansion yet adding incredibly fun games to the catalog, including new exclusive Arcade originals, along with two entirely new categories, App Store Greats and Timeless Classics.\",\n",
       "    \"Apple Pay continues to expand geographically, launching in Mexico and in South Africa, bringing our payment service to six continents. Wearables, home and accessories grew 25% year over year to $7.8 billion, setting new March quarter revenue records in every geographic segment. Apple Watch continues to extend its reach, with nearly 75% of the customers purchasing Apple Watch during the quarter being new to the product. We're very excited about the future of this category and believe that our integration of hardware, software and services uniquely positions us to provide great customer experiences in this category.\",\n",
       "    \"Next, I'd like to talk about Mac. We set an all-time revenue record of $9.1 billion, up 70% over last year, and grew very strongly in each geographic segment with all-time revenue records in Europe and rest of Asia Pacific and March quarter records in the Americas, Greater China and Japan. This amazing performance was driven by the very enthusiastic customer response to our new Macs powered by the M1 chip. IPad performance was also outstanding with revenue of $7.8 billion, up 79%.\",\n",
       "    'We grew very strongly in every geographic segment with an all-time record in Japan and a March quarter record in rest of Asia Pacific. Both Mac and iPad are incredibly relevant products for our customers in the current working and learning environments, and we are delighted that the most recent surveys of US consumers from 451 Research measured customer satisfaction at 91% for Mac and 94% for iPad. With this level of customer satisfaction, and with around half of the customers purchasing Mac and iPad during the quarter being new to that product, the active installed base for both products continues to grow nicely and reached new all-time highs. In the enterprise market, customers across many industries are accelerating their adoption of iPhone 12 and 5G as a key platform for the future of their business.',\n",
       "    'Delta Airlines, for example, is putting iPhone 12 and 5G connectivity into the hands of flight attendants so they can provide the best passenger service possible as air travel rebounds. Openreach in the UK has started equipping tens of thousands of field engineers with iPhone 12 to speed up their deployment of broadband services to homes around the country. And UCHealth, a large healthcare provider in Colorado, was able to reduce per patient vaccination time from three minutes to only 30 seconds largely by moving from PC stations to iPhones. This has allowed their staff to rapidly scan and register new patients and vastly increase their daily vaccination capacity.',\n",
       "    'Let me now turn to our cash position. We ended the quarter with over 204 billion in cash plus marketable securities. We issued $14 billion of new term debt and retired 3.5 billion of term debt, leaving us with total debt of almost 122 billion. As a result, net cash was 83 billion at the end of the quarter.',\n",
       "    'This strong position allows us to continue to invest confidently in our future, while also returning value to our shareholders. We are innovating and investing at an unprecedented pace, including accelerating our investment in the United States with our new commitment to contribute more than 430 billion and 20,000 jobs to the country over the next five years. As we continue to execute at an extremely high level, we were also able to return nearly 23 billion to shareholders during the March quarter. This included 3.4 billion in dividends and equivalents and 19 billion through open market repurchases of 147 million Apple shares.',\n",
       "    \"We continue to believe there is great value in our stock and maintain our target of reaching a net cash neutral position over time. Given the confidence we have in our business today and into the future, our board has authorized an additional 90 billion for share repurchases. We're also raising our dividend by 7% to $0.22 per share, and we continue to plan for annual increases in the dividend going forward. As we move ahead into the June quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Tejas referred to at the beginning of the call.\",\n",
       "    'Given the continued uncertainty around the world in the near term, we are not providing revenue guidance, but we are sharing some directional insights assuming that the COVID-related impacts to our business do not worsen from what we are seeing today for the current quarter. We expect our June quarter revenue to grow strong double digits year over year. However, we believe that the sequential revenue decline from the March quarter to the June quarter will be greater than in prior years for two reasons. First, keep in mind that due to the later launch timing and strong demand, iPhone only achieved supply demand balance during the March quarter.',\n",
       "    'This will cause a steeper sequential decline than usual. Second, we believe supply constraints will have a revenue impact of 3 to $4 billion in the June quarter. We expect gross margin to be between 41.5 and 42.5%. We expect opex to be between 11.1 and $11.3 billion.',\n",
       "    \"We expect OI&E to be around 50 million and our tax rate to be around 14.5%. Finally, reflecting the approved 7% dividend increase I just mentioned, today, our board of directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.22 per share of common stock payable on May 13, 2021, to shareholders of record as of May 10, 2021. With that, let's open the call to questions.\",\n",
       "    'Thank you, Luca. [Operator instructions] Operator, may we have the first question, please?',\n",
       "    'Questions & Answers:',\n",
       "    \"[Operator instructions] We'll take our first question from Shannon Cross with Cross Research. Please go ahead.\",\n",
       "    \"Tim, I had sort of a big picture question on iPhone. I'm just curious, there are so many different things happening in this cycle, 5G, pandemic. How are you thinking about the opportunity for refreshing the installed base and attracting new customers? And are you seeing lives shorten given some of the programs that are being put out there by the carriers and by yourself? Just kind of maybe big picture, if you can talk about what you're seeing in terms of iPhone out there in the market.\",\n",
       "    'Sure, Shannon. We saw double-digit increases on a year-over-year basis on both the new to iPhone and upgraders. And in fact, in the March quarter, there was actually a record number of upgraders for a March quarter. And so, we like what we see.',\n",
       "    \"You see in China, things have moved quickly to 5G. They're moving quickly in the United States. But a lot of the other regions are slower to adopt and slower to gain coverage in 5G.\",\n",
       "    \"OK. And then, Luca, can you talk about gross margin? I mean, 42% is higher than it's been that I can kind of remember actually at this point. So maybe if you talk about the drivers of gross margin. And maybe if there were any offsets from higher component costs or the logistics costs that obviously were overshadowed by currency and other things.\",\n",
       "    \"Yeah, Shannon. Yes, we did 42.5% during March, and we've guided to similar, slightly lower levels for June. So for March, we were up 270 basis points sequentially, really driven by three major factors. Cost savings, which has been good for us during the cycle.\",\n",
       "    'A really strong mix, a strong mix on iPhone, but in general, across all product categories, and that obviously was helpful. And foreign exchange sequentially, again, from December to March, was favorable 90 basis points. So that helped as well. So those are the three major factors there.',\n",
       "    \"As we transition into June, as you know, that we will expect some level of deleverage but that will be offset by cost savings. Foreign exchange doesn't have much of an impact as we go from March to June.\",\n",
       "    'Thank you.',\n",
       "    'Thanks, Shannon.',\n",
       "    \"We'll now take our next question from Amit Daryanani with Evercore.\",\n",
       "    'Thank you for taking my question. I have two as well. First one, just on services. I think 90 days ago, the expectation was that line item would decelerate a little bit into the March quarter.',\n",
       "    \"It turned out it actually accelerated for us. I'd like to just understand what do you think drove that acceleration specifically? And is mid-20% sort of the growth norm as we go forward for services?\",\n",
       "    \"During the March quarter, we've seen a return to growth on Apple Care and obviously, we've reopened a lot of the stores during the course of the quarter. And advertising, obviously, consumer sentiment has improved, and advertising is coming back. And so, the combination of these factors really delivered this very, very strong performance during the March quarter. As we look ahead, as you know, we don't provide specific guidance for our product categories.\",\n",
       "    \"Got it. That's helpful. And then, Tim, if I could follow up with you. It seems like engagement with iPhones and Apple devices generally has gone up materially over the last 12 months.\",\n",
       "    \"And I don't think replacement cycles, at least in the data we see, has shrunk or changed that much at the end of the day. I'm wondering, does that combination of increased usage, replacement cycles haven't changed, end up in iPhones potentially growing on a multiyear basis? Because, usually, I would imagine if I'm using something more, I have to replace it more often. So I'd love your perspective on it.\",\n",
       "    \"And so, we've only been operating for four and a half months or so. But clearly, we like what we see right now a lot. If you look at how the iPhone did around the world, we had the top five models of smartphone in the US, the top selling, the top two in urban China, four out of the top five in Japan, the top four in the UK and the top six in Australia. And so, it was a sort of across the board in some really key countries, we did really, really well.\",\n",
       "    \"I do think that the 5G cycle is important. And we're in the early days of it, frankly.\",\n",
       "    'Thanks, Amit. Can we have the next question, please?',\n",
       "    \"Absolutely. We'll take our next question from Katy Huberty from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\",\n",
       "    \"The shortages that Luca spoke about in the color that he provided on the future, affect primarily the iPad and the Mac. And so, we'll have some challenges in there, and challenges in meeting the demand that we've got. The demand feels very strong right now. Both on the Mac side, you have the combination of M1 and work from home and remote learning.\",\n",
       "    \"And then, iPad, you've got remote learning and work from home as well. And the product that we just announced is really killer, the iPad Pro with the M1 in it. And so, there's a lot of great things of the strength of the product cycle in addition to the trends that we're seeing in the marketplace. And where this pandemic will end, it seems like many companies will be operating in a hybrid kind of mode.\",\n",
       "    \"And then, Luca, as I look at inventory plus vendor nontrade receivables, that grew only about 8% this quarter which is a big deceleration from last quarter. Should we read into that as a leading indicator for how we should think about the revenue growth deceleration in the business as the world normalizes? Or were there some supply disruptions during the quarter that caused you to drain inventory and create that tightness that you're talking about for June?\",\n",
       "    \"So as you look at your model and you obviously can look at our numbers that we've done in the past, I think you can try to gauge that. From a channel inventory standpoint, we did what we normally do during a March quarter. So we reduced inventory as it's typical on iPhone. We exited within our target range.\",\n",
       "    'So I would say that on the inventory side, it was pretty straightforward. Obviously, given that the supply constraints are on the iPad and on the Mac, we wish we had more inventory of iPad and Mac. But this is all a function of high demand for all our products.',\n",
       "    'Thank you.',\n",
       "    'Thanks, Katy. Can we have the next question, please?',\n",
       "    \"Thank you. we'll take our next question from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America.\",\n",
       "    \"Hi, yeah. Thank you. Tim, your content offerings are still at very compelling price points. And you've seen other content providers, whether it be Spotify, Hulu, Netflix, all announced price increases recently.\",\n",
       "    \"I'm just wondering how you're thinking about pricing as it pertains to your offering here? And if you could share any stats around the uptake of TV+ paid subs that would be great. And I have a follow-up for Luca.\",\n",
       "    \"We're not releasing subscriber numbers. But we feel good about where we are. In terms of other services and pricing, I don't have anything to announce today. We try to give the customer a great value.\",\n",
       "    \"OK. As my follow-up, Luca, on the June quarter guide, when you talk about the sequential decline being a little bit about perhaps the 13% or low-teens percent that we've seen historically, are the supply constraints of the 3, 4 billion impact included in that? Or is that in addition to sort of the more than average sequential decline that you're referring to? And any color on what specifically is driving the supply constraints of the subcomponent level?\",\n",
       "    \"Yeah. So when you look at our normal seasonality, and you've mentioned a percentage there that is really an average of several years, what we're saying is that we believe that the sequential decline this year is going to be higher than that. And it's a combination of the two factors, right? One is the timing of the launch and then the very high demand for iPhone during the March quarter. And the 3 to 4 billion supply constraints that we mentioned.\",\n",
       "    'Thank you, Luca.',\n",
       "    'Thanks, Wamsi. Can we have the next question, please?',\n",
       "    \"Absolutely. We'll take our next question from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo.\",\n",
       "    \"Yeah. Thanks for taking the question and congratulations on the great quarter. I wanted to go back to iPhone. As we think about the iPhone 12 cycle, appreciating that you guys don't give actual shipment numbers, it would appear though that the mix has been quite healthy.\",\n",
       "    'Does that help?',\n",
       "    'Yeah. Can you give any context of how that might have changed this cycle relative to the prior cycles? Have we seen kind of a structural change to the higher band of the product category that you believe can be sustained going forward?',\n",
       "    \"We don't predict going forward other than for our own internal use. But we're really happy with the results.\",\n",
       "    \"OK. And then, as a quick follow-up back to the supply constraints. I guess it's hard to kind of see again, looking forward beyond this quarter. But what's your best assessment of when maybe the supply constraints could ease? Do you have any views of just the industry in general, overcoming some of the supply constraint dynamics?\",\n",
       "    \"I think we have a good handle on our demand. But what everybody else is doing, I don't know. And so, we will do our best. That's what I can tell you.\",\n",
       "    'Fair enough. Thank you.',\n",
       "    'Thank you, Aaron. Can we have our next question, please?',\n",
       "    \"Thank you. We'll take our next question from Harsh Kumar with Piper Sandler.\",\n",
       "    'Yeah. Hey, guys. Congratulations on a very nice quarter. Question on semis supply as well.',\n",
       "    \"You just beat by a substantial margin on the top line in the March quarter. I'm curious what went in your favor to be able to secure that kind of supply that you were able to beat by, I think it was $11 million or so? And then I had a follow-up.\",\n",
       "    'We did not have a material supply shortage in Q2. And so, how were we able to do that? You wind up collapsing all of your buffers and offsets. And that happens all the way through the supply chain. And so, that enables you to go a bit higher than what we were expecting to sell when we went into the quarter 90 days ago.',\n",
       "    \"That's very helpful. And then, for my follow-up, I know there's a lot of moving parts, Tim, but with the economy sort of reopening here in the US, and you mentioned about supply constraints possibly on the Mac and the iPad. I was curious if I can get your thoughts, maybe just color-wise, on what you would expect for those two categories, Macs and the iPads in the second half of this year.\",\n",
       "    \"Well, we don't predict or rev guide to product-level detail. We're not even guiding to the top level at this point because of COVID. And so, I'll sidestep that question. But I would point to Luca's point earlier about the shortages and those shortages primarily affect iPad and Mac.\",\n",
       "    'So we expect to be supply gated, not demand-gated.',\n",
       "    'Thank you, Harsh. Can we have the next question, please?',\n",
       "    \"Thank you. We'll take our next question from Krish Sankar with Cowen and\\xa0Company. Please go ahead.\",\n",
       "    'Yeah. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on a fantastic quarter. First question for Tim or Luca. The Greater China sales were very strong in the March quarter.',\n",
       "    'Can you give some color on what drove this strength? Which hardware products or services enabled the solid outperformance in China? And then I had a follow-up.',\n",
       "    \"We were very pleased with our performance in China. We set a March quarter revenue record and grew strong double digits across each of the product categories. And so, the revenue growth was broad. We've been especially pleased by the customer response in China to the iPhone 12 family.\",\n",
       "    \"And as I had mentioned earlier, you have to remember that China entered the shutdown phase earlier in Q2 of last year than other countries. And so, they were relatively more affected in that quarter, and that has to be taken into account as you look at the results. As I mentioned earlier, we had the top two selling smartphones in urban China, so we're very proud of that. And iPad, Mac both had enormously positive quarters with great strength across the board.\",\n",
       "    \"And we're seeing a strong reception to the new iPad Pro as well that we just announced. A lot of great comments. And about two-thirds of the people buying Mac and iPad were buying them for the first time. And so, we're attracting some new customers in China, which is really important to us.\",\n",
       "    'All right. That was very helpful, Tim. And then, maybe as a follow-up, I kind of have like a big picture philosophical question, and to the extent you can answer this. One of the concerns many investors have is about the overhang of regulatory risk.',\n",
       "    \"I understand it's very hard to handicap that. But I'm kind of curious, do you think giving more public disclosure on your services business like App Store would help alleviate some of those concerns? Or do you think that's revealing a lot of competitive details. But kind of curious to know what you think on services disclosure.\",\n",
       "    \"I think with the regulatory questions and scrutiny, we have to make sure that we're telling our story and why we do what we do, and we're very focused on doing that. If we feel that more disclosure would help, we would obviously move in that direction. The App Store and other parts of Apple are not cast in concrete. And so, we can move and are flexible with the times.\",\n",
       "    \"For example, in the App Store, as you know, just a couple of quarters ago, we lowered the commission rate for small developers to 15%. So that was an example of moving with the times, and we've gotten a great, great reception to that. And so, we continue to learn, and I think it's very important that we're very clear about why we do what we do. The idea behind curating the App Store in order to get the privacy and security that our customers want, I think is very important, and we have to convey that in a very straightforward manner.\",\n",
       "    'Very helpful. Thanks.',\n",
       "    'Yes. Thank you. Can we have the next question, please?',\n",
       "    \"Absolutely. We'll take our next question from Kyle McNealy with Jefferies.\",\n",
       "    \"Hi. Thanks for the question. One of the things we've been positive about is how growing iPhone sales can pull along Watch and AirPods sales, as well as customers shop the whole store. But you mentioned through COVID that accessories do much better in a physical store environment, and that's been hard due to the shutdowns, obviously.\",\n",
       "    'So my question is, have you seen any improvement in the attach rate for Watch and AirPods with iPhone? And can it get a lot better from here as the environment gets closer to normalization?',\n",
       "    \"I think we get a lot of benefit from our stores when they're open and are fully operational. And we're in better shape for parts of Q2 than we were previously, but we're still operating with a limited operational model in many stores. And there's still some stores today that are closed. Like stores in Michigan and stores in France and so forth.\",\n",
       "    \"And so, I think it will take some amount of time, but my view would be as the stores get back up to speed, fully up to speed, we should be able to increase some of the accessory sales. Although I think we're doing fairly well at the moment. So it's not something that we're not doing well. Online has been much more beneficial and much more productive than we would have guessed going into this.\",\n",
       "    'Great. Thanks a lot.',\n",
       "    'Thanks. Can we have the next question, please?',\n",
       "    \"We'll take our next question from David Vogt from UBS.\",\n",
       "    \"ATT's focus is really on the user and giving the user the ability to make a decision about whether they want to be tracked or not. And so, it's putting the user in the control. Not Apple, not another company, but the user of where it should be. And so, that's really the focus of it.\",\n",
       "    \"And the feedback that we've gotten from users, both before it went live when it was in the planning stages and so forth and after, has been tremendous. And so, we're really standing up on behalf of the consumer here.\",\n",
       "    'Great. Thanks.',\n",
       "    'Thank you. Can we have the next question, please?',\n",
       "    \"Absolutely. We'll take our next question from Samik Chatterjee from J.P.\\xa0Morgan.\",\n",
       "    'Hey, thanks for the question. I have a couple. And just wanted to get into the performance by geography here a bit. And Europe really exceptional results, particularly for this time of the year.',\n",
       "    \"Samik, I'll take that one. You're right. I mean we had great performance in Europe. We grew 56% during the quarter.\",\n",
       "    'And it was probably one of the geos where we actually saw results that were better than even our own expectations. We grew very strong double digits across the board, every product category. Particularly, I would say, iPad and Mac. They really was very, very strong.',\n",
       "    'Keep in mind that our Europe segment is a very broad version of Europe because it includes Western Europe, which has done very, very well. And then, Eastern Europe and it goes into the Middle East. Even India is part of Europe. And those emerging markets have done incredibly well, significantly better than company average.',\n",
       "    \"So very, very pleased with some of the results in India, for example, Russia, Middle East in general. So it's been very broad, both across product categories and across countries in Europe.\",\n",
       "    'OK. Got it. And just a quick follow-up for you, Luca. I think overall, just wanted to understand the implication of the investment plans that you announced recently for the US, the 430 billion over a multiyear period.',\n",
       "    'Getting some questions from investors of how to think about the implication on the run rate of operating expenses for the company.',\n",
       "    \"If you remember, we announced back in 2018 that we were making a very sizable commitment to the United States. At the time we announced $350 billion of investment over the following five years. And during these three years, since then, we've overachieved on those commitments, and we felt it was the right time to update these types of investments. And they span from, obviously, the investment that we made directly at Apple.\",\n",
       "    \"For example, we talked about the creation of 20,000 new jobs at Apple over the next five years in the United States. And of course, our business has grown. And so, our commitment, for example, to US suppliers grows over time, and that shows in the higher numbers. In the meantime, we've got into new businesses, for example, Apple TV+, a lot of the content that we developed for our TV service is produced here in the United States.\",\n",
       "    \"And so, that's additional investment here in the United States. From an opex standpoint, I think as you've seen this year, we're getting a lot of leverage. This is one of those years we said many times, sometimes our opex grows faster than revenue, and there are some other cycles where the opposite happens. We are growing revenue this year much faster than our opex increase.\",\n",

       "    'We achieved an all-time revenue record of $111.4 billion. We saw strong double-digit growth across every product category, and we achieved all-time revenue records in each of our geographic segments. It is not far from many of our minds that this result caps off the most challenging year any of us can remember. And it is an understatement to say that the challenges it posed to Apple as a business paled in comparison to the challenge it posed to Apple as a community of individuals, to employees, to their families, and to the communities we live in and love to call home.',\n",
       "    \"While these results show the central role that our products played in helping our users respond to these challenges, we are doubly aware that the work ahead of all of us to navigate the end of this pandemic, to restore normal life and prosperity in our neighborhoods and local economies, and to build back with a sense of justice is profound and urgent. We will speak to these needs and Apple's efforts throughout today's call, but I want to first offer the context of a detailed look at our results this quarter, including why we outperformed our expectations. Let's get started with hardware. We hit a new high watermark for our installed base of active devices, with growth accelerating as we passed 1.65 billion devices worldwide during the December quarter.\",\n",
       "    \"iPhone grew by 17% year over year, driven by strong demand for the iPhone 12 family, and our active installed base of iPhones is now over 1 billion. The customer response to the new iPhone 12 models' unprecedented innovation from world-class cameras to the great and growing potential of 5G has been enthusiastic, even in light of the ongoing COVID-19 impact at retail locations. iPad and Mac grew by 41% and 21%, respectively, reflecting the continuing role these devices have played in our users' lives during the COVID-19 pandemic. During this quarter, availability began for both our new iPad Air as well as the first generation of Macs to feature our groundbreaking M1 chip.\",\n",
       "    \"The demand for all of these products has been very strong. We have also continued our efforts to bring the latest iPad's enriching content and professional support to educators, students and parents. Educational districts and governments worldwide are continuing major deployments, including the largest iPad deployments ever to schools in Germany and Japan. Wearables, Home and Accessories grew by 30% year over year, driven by significant holiday demand for the latest Apple Watch, our entire AirPods lineup, including the new AirPods Max, as well as the new HomePod mini.\",\n",
       "    \"This broad strength across the category led to new revenue records for each of its three subgroups, and we're very excited about the road ahead for these products. Look no further than the great potential of Fitness+, which pairs with Apple Watch to deliver real-time, on-screen fitness data alongside world-class workouts by the world's best trainers. There are new sessions added each week, and customers are loving the flexibility, challenge, and fun of these classes, as well as how the pairing with Apple Watch pushes you to achieve your fitness goals. This deep integration of hardware, software, and services have always defined our approach here, and it has delivered an all-time quarterly services record of $15.8 billion.\",\n",
       "    'This was the first quarter of the Apple One bundle, which brings together many of our great services into an easy subscription; and with new content being added to these services every day, we feel very optimistic about where we are headed. The App Store ecosystem has been so important as individuals, families, and businesses worldwide evolve and adapt to the COVID-19 pandemic, and we want to make sure that this unrivaled engine of innovation and opportunity continues. This quarter, we also took a significant new step to help smaller developers continue to experiment, innovate and scale the latest great app ideas. The App Store Small Business Program reduces the commission on the sale of digital goods and services to 15% for small businesses earning less than $1 million a year.',\n",
       "    \"The program launched on January 1, and we are already hearing from developers about how this change represents a transformation in their potential to create and grow on the App Store. Tomorrow is International Privacy Day, and we continue to set new standards to protect users' right to privacy, not just for our own products but to be the ripple in the pond that moves the whole industry forward. Most recently, we're in the process of deploying new requirements across the App Store ecosystem that give users more knowledge about and new tools to control the ways that apps gather and share their personal data. The winter holiday season is always a busy time for us and our products.\",\n",
       "    'But this year was unique. We had a record number of device activations during the last week of the quarter. And as COVID-19 kept us apart, we saw the highest volume of FaceTime calls ever this Christmas. As always, we could not have made so many holidays special without our talented and dedicated retail teams who helped us achieve a new all-time revenue record for retail, driven by very strong performance in our online store.',\n",
       "    \"Particularly, after the events of the last few weeks, we're focused on how we can help a moment of great national need. Because none of us should have any illusions about the challenges we face as we begin a new chapter in the American story, hope for healing, for unity, and for progress begins with and depends on addressing the things that continue to wound us. In our communities, we see how every burden from COVID-19 to the resulting economic challenges, to the closure of in-person learning for students, falls heaviest on those who have always faced structural barriers to opportunity and equality. This month, Apple announced major new commitments through a $100 million Racial Equity and Justice Initiative.\",\n",
       "    'The Propel Center launched with a $25 million commitment and with the support of historically black colleges and universities across the country, will help support the next generation of leaders in fields ranging from machine learning to app development to entrepreneurship and design. And our new Apple Developer Academy in downtown Detroit will be the first of its kind in the United States. Detroit has a vibrant culture of Black entrepreneurship, including over 50,000 Black-owned businesses. We want to accelerate the potential of the app economy here, knowing there is no shortage of good ideas in such a creative, resilient, and dedicated community.',\n",
       "    \"Finally, we're committing $35 million across two investments in Harlem Capital and the Clear Vision Impact Fund that support, accelerate, and grow minority-owned businesses in areas of great potential and need. In December, we concluded an unmatched year of giving. Since the inception of the Apple Giving program in 2011, Apple employees have donated nearly $600 million and volunteered more than 1.6 million hours to over 34,000 organizations of every stride. Through our partnership with (PRODUCT)RED, we've adapted our 14-year $250 million effort to support HIV and AIDS work globally to ensure that care continues even in the time of COVID.\",\n",
       "    \"That includes delivering millions of units of personal protective equipment to healthcare providers in Zambia. And here in the United States, even with COVID's effects, we are ahead of schedule on our multiyear commitment to invest $350 billion throughout the American economy. As proud as this makes us, we know there is much more to be done. Looking forward, we continue to contend with the COVID-19 pandemic, but we must also now work to imagine what we will inherit on the other side.\",\n",
       "    'When a disease recedes, we cannot simply assume that healing follows. Even now, we see the deep scars that this period has left in our communities. Trust has been compromised. Opportunities have been lost.',\n",
       "    \"Entire portions of our lives that we took for granted, schools for children, meetings with our colleagues, small businesses that have endured for generations have simply disappeared. It will take a societywide effort across the public and private sectors as individuals and communities, every one of us, to ensure that what's ahead of us is not simply the end of a disease but the beginning of something durable and hopeful for those who gave, suffered, and endured during this time. At Apple, we have every intention to be partners in this effort, and we look forward to working in communities around the world to make it possible. And as this chapter of uncertainty continues, so will our tireless work to help our customers stay safe, connected, and well.\",\n",
       "    \"With that, I'll hand things over to Luca.\",\n",
       "    'Thank you, Tim. Good afternoon, everyone. We started our fiscal 2021 with exceptional business and financial performance during the December quarter as we set all-time records for revenue, operating income, net income, earnings per share, and operating cash flow. We are thrilled with the way our teams continued to innovate and execute throughout this period of elevated uncertainty.',\n",
       "    'Our revenue reached an all-time record of $111.4 billion, an increase of nearly $20 billion or 21% from a year ago. We grew strong double digits in each of our product categories, with all-time records for iPhone; wearables, Home and Accessories; and services, as well as a December quarter record for Mac. We also achieved double-digit growth and new all-time records in each of our five geographic segments and in the vast majority of countries that we track. Products revenue was an all-time record of $95.7 billion, up 21% over a year ago.',\n",
       "    \"As a consequence of this level of sales performance and the unmatched loyalty of our customers, our installed base of active devices passed 1.65 billion during the December quarter and reached an all-time record in each of our major product categories. Our services set an all-time record of $15.8 billion, growing 24% year over year. We established new all-time records in most service categories and December quarter records in each geographic segment. I'll cover our services business in more detail later.\",\n",
       "    'Company gross margin was 39.8%, up 160 basis points sequentially, thanks to leverage from higher sales and a strong mix. Products gross margin was 35.1%, growing 530 basis points sequentially, driven by leverage and mix. Services gross margin was 68.4%, up 150 basis points sequentially, mainly due to a different mix. Net income, diluted earnings per share, and operating cash flow were all-time records.',\n",
       "    'Net income was $28.8 billion, up $6.5 billion or 29% over last year. Diluted earnings per share were $1.68, up 35% over last year, and operating cash flow was $38.8 billion, an improvement of $8.2 billion. Let me get into more detail for each of our revenue categories. iPhone revenue was a record $65.6 billion, growing 17% year over year as demand for the iPhone 12 family was very strong despite COVID-19 and social distancing measures, which have impacted store operations in a significant manner.',\n",
       "    'Our active installed base of iPhones reached a new all-time high and has now surpassed 1 billion devices, thanks to the exceptional loyalty of our customer base and strength of our ecosystem. In fact, in the U.S., the latest survey of consumers from 451 Research indicates iPhone customer satisfaction of 98% for the iPhone 12 family. Turning to services. As I said, we reached an all-time revenue record of $15.8 billion and set all-time records in App Store, cloud services, Music, advertising, AppleCare, and payment services.',\n",
       "    'Our new service offerings, Apple TV+, Apple Arcade, Apple News+, Apple Card, Apple Fitness+, as well as the Apple One bundle are also contributing to overall services growth and continue to add users, content, and features. The key drivers for our services growth all continue to move in the right direction: First, our installed base growth has accelerated and is an all-time high across each major product category; second, the number of both transacting and paid accounts on our digital content stores reached a new all-time high during the December quarter with paid accounts increasing double digits in each of our geographic segments; third, paid subscriptions continue to grow nicely, and we exceeded our target of 600 million paid subscriptions before the end of calendar 2020. During the December quarter, we added more than 35 million sequentially, and we now have more than 620 million paid subscriptions across the services on our platform, up 140 million from just a year ago. Finally, we continue to improve the breadth and quality of our current services offerings and are adding new services that we think our customers will love.',\n",
       "    'For example, Apple Music recently released its biggest product update ever with features like Listen Now, all new search, personal radio stations, and autoplay. 90% of Apple Music users on iOS 14 have already used these new features. In payment services, we continue to expand our coverage with nearly 90% of stores in the United States now accepting Apple Pay so that customers can easily have a touchless payments experience. Wearables, Home and Accessories grew 30% year over year to $13 billion, setting new all-time revenue records in every geographic segment.',\n",
       "    \"As a result of this strong performance, our Wearables business is now the size of a Fortune 120 company. Importantly, Apple Watch continues to extend its reach with nearly 75% of the customers purchasing Apple Watch during the quarter being new to the product. We're very excited about the future of this category and believe that our integration of hardware, software, and services uniquely positions us to provide great customer experience in this category. Next, I'd like to talk about Mac.\",\n",
       "    'We set a December quarter record for revenue at $8.7 billion, up 21% over last year. We grew strong double-digits in each geographic segment and set all-time revenue records in Europe and rest of Asia Pacific as well as December quarter records in the Americas, Greater China, and in Japan. This performance was driven by strong demand for the new MacBook Air, MacBook Pro, and Mac mini, all powered by our brand-new M1 chip. iPad performance was also very impressive with revenue of $8.4 billion, up 41%.',\n",
       "    'With this level of customer satisfaction and with around half of the customers purchasing Mac and iPad during the quarter being new to that product, the active installed base for both products continues to grow nicely and reached new all-time highs. In the enterprise market, we are seeing many businesses shifting their technology investment in response to COVID. One example is how businesses are handling their hundreds of millions of office desk phones while more employees are working remotely. Last quarter, Mitsubishi UFG Bank, one of the largest banks in the world, announced that it will be replacing 75% of its fixed phones with iPhones.',\n",
       "    \"By doing so, it expects to realize significant cost savings while providing a secure mobile platform to employees. We're also pleased with the rapid adoption of the Mac Employee Choice Program among the world's leading businesses, who are seeing improved productivity, increased employee satisfaction, and talent retention. With the introduction of M1-powered Macs, we're excited to extend these experiences to an even broader range of customers and employees, especially in times of increased remote working. Let me now turn to our cash position.\",\n",
       "    \"We ended the quarter with almost $196 billion in cash plus marketable securities and retired $1 billion of maturing debt, leaving us with total debt of $112 billion. As a result, net cash was $84 billion at the end of the quarter. We returned over $30 billion to shareholders during the December quarter, including $3.6 billion in dividends and equivalents and $24 billion through open market repurchases of 200 million Apple shares as we continue on our path to reaching a net cash neutral position over time. As we move ahead into the March quarter, I'd like to provide some color on what we are seeing, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Tejas referred to at the beginning of the call.\",\n",
       "    'Given the continued uncertainty around the world in the near term, we will not be guiding to a specific revenue range. However, we are providing some directional insights assuming that COVID-related impacts of our business do not worsen from our current assumptions for the quarter. For total company revenue, we believe growth will accelerate on a year-over-year basis and in aggregate, follow typical seasonality on a sequential basis. At the product category level, keep in mind two items: First, during the March quarter last year, we saw elevated activity in our digital services as lockdowns occurred around the world, so our services business faces a tougher year-over-year comparison; second, we believe the year-over-year growth in the Wearables, Home and Accessories category will decelerate compared to Q1.',\n",
       "    'As you know, we were chasing demand on AirPods last year as we expanded channel inventory from Q1 to Q2. This year, we plan to decrease AirPods channel inventory as is typical after the holiday quarter. We expect gross margin to be similar to the December quarter. We expect opex to be between $10.7 billion and $10.9 billion.',\n",
       "    \"We expect OI&E to be up around $50 million and our tax rate to be around 17%. Finally, today, our board of directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.205 per share of common stock payable on February 11, 2021, to shareholders of record as of February 8, 2021.

       "    'Thank you. Congratulations on a really strong quarter. First question for Luca. The gross margin was particularly strong versus your outlook.',\n",
       "    'Can you talk about whether you recognize the full impact of the weaker dollar in the December quarter given your typical currency hedges? And then how are you thinking about the headwinds and tailwinds on gross margins as you go into the March quarter? And then I have a follow-up for Tim.',\n",
       "    'Yes, Katy. So yes, the gross margin was strong, was better than we had anticipated at the beginning of the quarter. The reason for that was obviously we had very strong leverage from higher sales. And the mix was strong, both the mix within products and the mix of services, and that was only partially offset by cost.',\n",
       "    'Clearly, if the dollar remains weak or continues to weaken, that can become a tailwind for us as we get into the March quarter. At current rates, we expect some level of benefit around 60 to 70 basis points for the March quarter.',\n",
       "    \"That's great. Thank you. And Tim, one of the challenges with valuing Apple is just a limited visibility that investors have into the road map and any new categories that you might enter overtime. Without, of course, commenting on any given opportunity, can you talk about the framework that you use internally to evaluate new markets that might be attractive and what you believe will determine your success as you look to enter new markets?\",\n",

Was it more on the unit side or the ASP side? You referred to very strong mix a couple of times on the call. And how does this change your view on the March quarter? And if you could share any color on if you're still supply constrained, and I have a follow-up for Tim.\",\n",

But I'm curious, both from an iPhone, as well as your other product categories, what you're seeing and how much back to normal you think the Chinese market is. And then I have a follow-up.\",\n",
       "    'Thank you.',\n",
       "    'Thank you.',\n",
       "    \"Yeah. I mean, really, it's been strong across the board. There are two businesses during COVID that have been impacted negatively, and we then talked about it in the past. One is AppleCare.\",\n",
       "    \"Clearly, the strength was in digital services, in the App Store, in cloud services, in music. Those were the services that really delivered very, very strong performance. It's something that we've seen happen during the COVID environment.\",\n",
       "    'All right. Thank you.',\n",
       "    'Thanks, Shannon. Can we have the next question, please?',\n",
       "    \"We'll hear from Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein.\",\n",
       "    \"Certainly, last year is not typical because of COVID. But if you go back, fiscal '17, '18, '19, that's our typical seasonal progression. And we mentioned a couple of product categories, Services, and Wearables, where we're going to be having a slightly more difficult compare. And so I think you can draw your conclusions around the iPhone.\",\n",
       "    'OK. Thank you for that. And then, Tim, I was wondering if you could just comment more broadly around growth for Apple and sources of growth. The company this year is going to be well over $300 billion in revenue.',\n",
       "    \"Historically, you've eschewed acquisitions. And I'm wondering if you could comment whether you still feel confident that Apple has Apple organic growth opportunities and that you don't believe acquisitions are an important source of growth. And then I think perhaps most importantly, as you look out, let's say, over the next five years, what do you think is a realistic revenue growth rate for Apple going forward? Thank you.\",\n",
       "    \"We have an installed base that has hit new highs that we just talked about earlier in our opening comments. And we're still attracting a fair number of switchers and, of course, upgraders. We just set an all-time Services record, and we have that installed base to compound that, and particularly with the added services that we've had over the last year or so, that as they grow and mature, will contribute even more to the Services revenue stream. And on the Wearables side, we've brought this thing from zero to a Fortune 120 company, which was no small feat.\",\n",
       "    'Thank you.',\n",
       "    'Thank you. Can we have the next question, please?',\n",
       "    \"Yes. We'll hear from Amit Daryanani with Evercore ISI.\",\n",
       "    \"Perfect. Thank you. I have two questions as well. Starting with you, Luca, I just wanted to go back to the gross margin discussion, and we really haven't seen gross margins at this level, high 39%, I think, since 2016.\",\n",
       "    'Could you maybe step back and talk about what has enabled the shift higher? What are the key drivers to get you there? And is commodity tailwinds or in-sourcing of some components really a big part of this? So just love to understand the durability of the gross margin at these levels. And what are the big drivers that got us here?',\n",

       "    'When you look at your Services segment in the March quarter, in China, you typically see a bump due to gaming downloads during Chinese New Year. So should we see a similar trend this time around? But do you think with the pandemic and people staying primarily at home, that kind of seasonal bump might not happen in China for gaming downloads?',\n",
       "    'And so that propensity for playing games continued for several weeks, more than a typical cycle.

       "    \"So as I said earlier, we grew iPhone revenue 17%, and that growth came from both unit sales and ASPs because of the strong mix that I mentioned before. So I think that answers your question for the December quarter. What we've seen so far, it's very early because we launched the new products only a few weeks ago. What we've seen so far is a very high level of interest for the Pro models, the Pro and the Pro Max.\",\n",
       "    \"We worked very hard to ramp up our supply. We've had some supply constraints during the December quarter. We think we're going to be able to solve them during the March quarter. But so far, the mix has been very, very strong on iPhone.\",\n",

Did that provide a benefit, in your view, on units or mix or perhaps both? And what would be the level of permanence that you would see in some of those actions such that if those subsidies were removed, could that potentially be a headwind going forward?\",\n",

A lot of the pushback we get on our view on Apple is that everyone around them or that they know in developed countries has an iPhone or Apple product and the market is kind of being saturated some. But when I look at other countries like India, I believe statistically, you are materially below that in market share.\",\n",
       "    \"So are you doing active efforts there? It seems like there's been some news reports of moving supply chain there or you recently opened up an Apple Store. How should we think about that? Because it just seems like you're really not full market share equally around the world.\",\n",
       "    \"We are doing a number of things in the area. We put the online store there, for example, and last quarter was the first full quarter of the online store.

These statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results or trends to differ materially from our forecast. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in Apple's most recently filed annual report on Form 10-K and the Form 8-K filed with the SEC today, along with the associated press release. Apple assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements or information, which speak as of their respective dates.\",\n",
       "    \"I'd now like to turn the call over to Tim for introductory remarks.\",\n",
       "    \"Thanks, Tejas, and good afternoon, and thanks for joining the call today. Back in April, I said we were in the most challenging environment in which Apple as a company has ever operated. That atmosphere of uncertainty, of resolve, of making difficult calls with limited information, has not only come to define Apple's year but each of our lives as individuals across this country and around the world. It has been a chapter that none of us will forget.\",\n",
       "    'In the face of these challenges, Apple stayed relentlessly focused on what we do best, seeing in every obstacle an opportunity to do something new, something creative, something better on behalf of our customers. Today, we report a quarter and a fiscal year that reflects that effort. This quarter, Apple achieved revenue of $64.7 billion, a September quarter record despite the anticipated absence of new iPhone availability during the quarter and the ongoing impacts of COVID-19, including closures at many of our retail locations. We also set a new all-time record for Mac and services.',\n",
       "    \"Outside of iPhone, each of our product categories saw strong double-digit year-over-year growth despite supply constraints in several product categories. Our results for this quarter were ahead of our expectations, driven by stronger-than-expected iPhone and services performance. As we anticipated, we launched new iPhone models in October, a few weeks later than last year's mid-September launch. Up to that mid-September point, customer demand for iPhone was very strong and grew double digits.\",\n",
       "    \"On services, we saw stronger-than-expected performance across the board. Geographically, we set September quarter records in the Americas, Europe and rest of Asia Pacific. We also set a September quarter record in India, thanks in part to a very strong reception to this quarter's launch of our online store in the country. Greater China is the region that was most heavily impacted by the absence of the new iPhones during the September quarter.\",\n",
       "    \"Still, we beat our internal expectations in the region, growing non-iPhone revenue strong double digits, and iPhone customer demand grew through mid-September. When you pull back the lens to the entire fiscal year, it's a testament to the team's work and to the resilience of the business in the era of COVID-19. This year, we set an all-time revenue record of $274.5 billion, growing 6% year on year. We grew every quarter, set all-time yearly records in Mac, wearables, home and accessories and services and grew by double digits in every product category outside of iPhone.\",\n",
       "    \"When we first began to grapple with COVID-19, I said there are worse things for a company whose business is innovation than having to periodically do just about everything in an entirely new way. This year, we not only launched our most powerful and compelling generation of hardware, software and services ever, we did it in a way that pushed us to reimagine every part of that innovation process down to how we share these announcements with the world and how we get new products into our customers' hands. Working from kitchen tables and bedrooms, in distanced office settings and reworked labs and manufacturing facilities, the team rebuilt every part of the plane while it was midair, and the results speak for themselves. In a year that has been enormously challenging, our retail teams, contact centers and all those who work with our customers most closely have gone to creative and dedicated lengths to keep serving our customers, from adapting our stores for contactless pickup to new Apple express storefronts to new online customer support options.\",\n",
       "    \"Amid store closings, reopenings and reimaginings, these teams have been an unfailing source of energy, creativity and determination. Innovation isn't just about what you make, it's about how you approach problems, and these teams and every team across Apple have not faced a single question this year that they haven't found an answer to with passion and resolve. Their actions didn't just meet the moment, they will make us a better company moving forward. The pandemic has hit home for all of us, and at Apple, we have seen it as a call to action.\",\n",
       "    'We have seen the pain in our communities. Many of us have seen our children work hard to adapt to remote learning. And we all know that the road ahead is uncertain. This quarter and throughout the year, our response to this crisis has been to ask, how can we help? In terms of COVID-19 response, that has meant sourcing and donating millions of face masks, designing and manufacturing millions of face shields and scaling the production of millions of test kits.',\n",
       "    \"But we have tried to live our values more broadly. We've pledged $100 million to our new Racial Equity and Justice Initiative. We've committed to be fully carbon-neutral by 2030 across our entire supply chain and device usage as massive wildfires, hurricanes and floods bring home the consequences of climate change for all of us. And we've deepened our enduring educational partnerships, from coding education beginning in elementary school to new efforts with dozens of historically black colleges and universities.\",\n",
       "    'One of the many areas where COVID-19 continues to have a significant impact is in education. As teachers, students and parents alike work hard to keep education relevant, creative and effective, our products have helped them meet the moment. In a typical year, the back-to-school season is a bustling time for us. This year, that was true in the biggest way ever.',\n",
       "    \"We've helped school districts around the world meet this moment in an unprecedented way, including starting nine of our 10 largest school district deployments ever that alone will support over 1 million students and teachers. We have also supported these deployments and educators and learners everywhere with free tools and training, reaching over 150,000 teachers and millions of parents and students around the world. Looking forward, we feel great optimism about the road in front of us. We're in the midst of our most prolific product introduction period ever.\",\n",
       "    'In addition to the announcement of HomePod mini, which achieves unmatched sound quality and Siri and smart home capabilities in a small and affordable format, we just marked the beginning of a new era for iPhone with the arrival of our first 5G-enabled devices. The iPhone 12 and 12 mini boast powerful breakthroughs like an edge-to-edge Super Retina XDR display, unprecedented durability with a new Ceramic Shield developed with our partners at Corning, new MagSafe charging and accessories, the fastest-ever A14 Bionic chip and a new dual camera system driven by computational photography. The iPhone 12 Pro and 12 Pro Max take all of this to an even higher level, driven by the most powerful photo and video tools ever delivered by a smartphone, including an all-new LiDAR scanner and the ability to shoot in Apple ProRaw and full Dolby video. And of course, all of these devices bring the 5G experience users have been waiting for, with lightning-fast downloads and uploads, a new standard in video streaming, more responsive gaming and much more.',\n",
       "    \"The early product reviews have been tremendously positive, and our customers have been similarly excited to get their hands on this next era of devices. We're very optimistic about what the next few weeks will bring. We're also seeing a very positive response to our September announcement. The all-new Apple Watch Series 6 boasts powerful new health and wellness features, including a blood oxygen sensor, a next-generation altimeter and a wide variety of new colors and bands.\",\n",
       "    \"The potential for Apple Watch's powerful health and wellness capabilities continues to grow. Just yesterday, the government of Singapore and Apple launched LumiHealth, a first-of-its-kind program designed to encourage healthy activity and behaviors using Apple Watch. Created in collaboration with a team of physicians and public health experts, LumiHealth uses technology and behavioral insights to encourage Singaporeans to keep healthy and complete wellness challenges through their Apple Watch and iPhone. Singapore is a trailblazer here, and we're proud to be their partner.\",\n",
       "    \"Our iPad lineup continues to set the pace for the category, including the new iPad Air now shipping with the A14 Bionic, our most powerful chip ever. We announced Apple Fitness Plus, which delivers deep personalization and integration across the fitness tools our users love and depend on. And Apple One, launching tomorrow, is the easiest way for users to enjoy Apple services like Music, TV Plus Arcade, iCloud, News Plus and Fitness Plus on a single plan that is right for them and their family. Looking across services more broadly, we're really excited about what we see.\",\n",
       "    'This was a record quarter for the App Store, AppleCare, cloud services, Music and payment services. The App Store, in particular, continues to play an essential role in helping small businesses, educational institutions and workplaces adapt to COVID-19. Apple TV Plus continues to impress from fan favorites like Ted Lasso, which has won a worldwide audience with its hopeful tone during challenging times, to critical and award praise, including a Primetime Emmy for Billy Crudup in The Morning Show. Luca will speak in greater detail about our expectations for the December quarter.',\n",
       "    \"Without giving away too much, I can tell you that this year has a few more exciting things in store. Before I hand things off, I want to offer one more comment on resilience because I think if I had to describe our performance this quarter in a single word, it's resilient. Financial performance aside, I don't think this year will be a time that any of us look back on with great fondness or nostalgia. Those of us who wake up every day hoping for a return to normal can count ourselves fortunate.\",\n",
       "    \"Others don't have that luxury. There is the great pain of a lost loved one, the uncertainty and fear of a lost job, a deep well of concern for people we care about who we are not able to see. A sense of opportunities missed, of plans delayed, of time lost. Even though we are apart, it's been obvious this year that around the company, teams and colleagues have been leaning on and counting on each other more than in normal times.\",\n",
       "    \"I think that instinct, that resilience has been an essential part of how we have navigated this year. Work can't solve for all the things we're missing right now, but a shared sense of purpose goes a long way. A belief that we can do more together than we can alone, that people of goodwill, driven by creativity and passion and that certain itch of a big idea, can still do things that help other people in our own small way to teach, to learn, to create or just to relax at a time like this. Even as the things we make require us to operate at the very cutting edge of technology, in materials, products and ideas that didn't exist just a few years ago, this year has forced us to face plainly the things that make us human: disease, resilience and hope.\",\n",
       "    \"You never wish for a year like this one, but I couldn't be prouder of the team, the work we have done and the small role we have played in helping our communities find hope and resilience in this time. With that, I'll hand things over to Luca.\",\n",
       "    \"Thank you, Tim. Good afternoon, everyone. We're very pleased to report today a new September quarter revenue record, which caps a remarkable level of performance for our fiscal-year 2020, during which we set new all-time records for revenue, earnings per share and free cash flow in spite of an extremely volatile and challenging macro environment. We could not be more proud of the way our team has innovated and executed throughout this unprecedented period of uncertainty.\",\n",
       "    'We reported total revenue of $64.7 billion for the September quarter, up 1% from a year ago. This is a very impressive level of performance when we consider that this year, we did not launch and ship any new iPhone models during the quarter. Outside of iPhone, we grew 25% in aggregate and had strong double-digit year-over-year revenue growth in each of our product categories. We set all-time records for Mac and services and a September quarter record for wearables, home and accessories.',\n",
       "    'We also achieved new September quarter records in the vast majorities of countries that we track, including, among others, the U.S., Canada, Brazil, Germany, France, Italy, Spain, Turkey, Russia, India, Korea, Thailand, Malaysia and Vietnam. Products revenue was $50.1 billion, with very strong underlying performance across each product category. Our products outside of iPhone grew a combined 30% despite supply constraints on iPad, Mac and Apple Watch throughout the quarter. For iPhone, through mid-September, customer demand grew double digits.',\n",
       "    \"As a result of this level of sales performance and the unmatched loyalty of our customers, our installed base of active devices reached an all-time high in aggregate and in each of our major product categories. Our services set an all-time record of $14.5 billion, growing 16% year over year. We established new all-time records in many services categories and September quarter records in each geographic segment. I'll cover this in more detail later.\",\n",
       "    'Company gross margin was 38.2%. This was up 20 basis points sequentially due to cost savings and a higher mix of services, partially offset by a different mix of products. Products gross margin was 29.8%, growing 10 basis points sequentially, driven by cost savings, partially offset by a different mix. Services gross margin was 66.9%, decreasing 30 basis points sequentially, mainly due to a different mix.',\n",
       "    'Let me get into more detail for each of our product categories. iPhone revenue was $26.4 billion as we did not have availability of new iPhone models during the September quarter this year, which we had mentioned during our call in July. While COVID-19 and social distancing measures impacted store operations in a significant manner, demand for iPhone remained very strong. In fact, through mid-September, customer demand for our current product lineup grew double digits and was well above our expectations.',\n",
       "    'Our active installed base of iPhones reached a new all-time high, thanks to the exceptional loyalty of our customer base and strength of our ecosystem. In fact, in the U.S., the last survey of consumers from 451 Research indicates iPhone customer satisfaction of 98% for iPhone 11, 11 Pro and 11 Pro Max combined. Turning to services, as I said, we set an all-time revenue record of $14.5 billion. We grew strong double digits and set all-time records in App Store, cloud services, Music, advertising and payment services.',\n",
       "    'We also set an all-time record in AppleCare as in-store traffic improved and we were able to support more customers. Our new services, Apple TV Plus Apple Arcade, Apple News Plus and Apple Card, are also contributing to overall services growth and continue to add users, content and features. The key drivers for our services growth all continue to be moving in the right direction. First, our installed base continues to grow and is an all-time high across each major product category.',\n",
       "    'Second, the number of both transacting and paid accounts on our digital content stores reached a new all-time high. during the September quarter, with paid accounts increasing double digits in each of our geographic segments. Third, paid subscriptions grew more than 35 million sequentially, and we now have over 585 million paid subscriptions across the services on our platform, up 135 million from just a year ago. With this momentum, we are very confident to reach and exceed our increased target of 600 million paid subscriptions before the end of calendar 2020.',\n",
       "    'Finally, as Tim mentioned, we continue to improve the breadth and the quality of our current services offerings and are adding new service offerings that we think our customers will love, like Apple One and Apple Fitness Plus. Wearables, home and accessories established a new September quarter record with revenue of $7.9 billion, up 21% year over year. We set September quarter records in every geographic segment and for each of the three product categories: wearables, home and accessories. As a result, our wearables business is now the size of a Fortune 130 company.',\n",
       "    \"Importantly, Apple Watch continues to extend its reach, with over 75% of the customers purchasing Apple Watch during the quarter being new to the product. We're very excited about the future of this category, including the recent launches of our new products: Apple Watch Series 6 and SE, HomePod mini and the MagSafe ecosystem of accessories. Next, I'd like to talk about Mac. Revenue was, by far, an all-time record at $9 billion, up 29% over last year and $1.6 billion above our previous record in spite of supply constraints during the quarter.\",\n",
       "    'We grew strong double digits in each geographic segment and set all-time revenue records in the Americas and rest of Asia Pacific, as well as September quarter records in Europe and Japan. We have seen amazing customer response to the new MacBook Air and MacBook Pro and very strong demand during the back-to-school season. IPad performance was also very impressive with revenue of $6.8 billion, up 46% and our highest September quarter revenue in eight years despite supply constraints. Demand exceeded our expectations around the world as we grew very strong double digits in every geographic segment, including an all-time record in Japan and a September quarter record in the Americas.',\n",
       "    'Both Mac and iPad are incredibly relevant products for our customers in the current working and learning environments, and we are delighted that the most recent surveys of consumers from 451 Research measured customer satisfaction at 93% for Mac and 95% for iPad. With this level of customer satisfaction and with around half of the customers purchasing Mac and iPad during the quarter being new to that product, it is no surprise that the active installed base for both products reached a new all-time high. In the enterprise market, our products are helping companies grow their business while achieving their sustainability goals. One example is Vestas, a leading producer of wind turbines.',\n",
       "    'Another example of how organizations are using Apple products to reduce carbon impact is digitizing paper workflows. In Switzerland alone, Zurich Insurance has reduced paper consumption by over 10,000 sheets per day by equipping 1,000 customer advisors with iPads. Air Canada is reducing its carbon footprint by over 2,200 metric tons annually by loading flight plans and manuals onto iPads rather than using paper. We are thrilled that our products are helping businesses run more efficiently and sustainably.',\n",
       "    'Let me now turn to our cash position. We ended the quarter with almost $192 billion in cash plus marketable securities. We issued $5.5 billion of new term debt and decreased short-term borrowing facilities by $6.2 billion during the quarter, leaving us with total debt of $112 billion. As a result, net cash was $79 billion at the end of the quarter as we continue on our path to reaching a net cash neutral position over time.',\n",
       "    \"We returned nearly $22 billion to shareholders during the September quarter, including $3.5 billion in dividends and equivalents and $18 billion through open market repurchases of 168.7 million Apple shares. We also retired an additional 3.1 million shares in the final settlement of our 16th ASR. Before looking ahead, I want to provide just a few highlights for the amazing fiscal year we just completed. In fiscal '20, we grew revenue by 6% to $274.5 billion, a new all-time record.\",\n",
       "    'We showed remarkable resilience throughout the year as we were able to grow both revenue and installed base of active devices in every quarter. In spite of the most challenging economic environment we can remember, we set new revenue records in the Americas, in Europe and in the rest of Asia Pacific. We grew our business outside of iPhone by 16%. We grew earnings per share 10% to a new all-time record.',\n",
       "    \"And most importantly, we continued to deliver innovative products and services that our customers love. As we move ahead into the December quarter, I'd like to provide some color on what we are seeing, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Tejas referred to at the beginning of the call. Given the continued uncertainty around the world in the near term, we will not be issuing revenue guidance for the coming quarter. However, we are providing some insights on our expectations for the December quarter for our product categories.\",\n",
       "    \"These directional comments assume that COVID-related impacts to our business in November and December are similar to what we've seen in October. We just started shipping iPhone 12 and 12 Pro, and we're off to a great start. We are also excited to start preorders on iPhone 12 mini and 12 Pro Max next Friday. Given the tremendously positive response, we expect iPhone revenue to grow during the December quarter despite shipping iPhone 12 and 12 Pro 4 weeks into the quarter and iPhone 12 mini and 12 Pro Max 7 weeks into the quarter.\",\n",
       "    'We expect all other products in aggregate to grow double digits, and we also expect services to continue to grow double digits. For gross margin, we expect it to be similar to our most recent quarters despite the costs associated with the launch of several new products. For opex, we expect to be between $10.7 billion and $10.8 billion. We expect OI&E to be around $50 million and the tax rate to be around 16%.',\n",
       "    \"Finally, today, our board of directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.205 per share of common stock payable on November 12, 2020, to shareholders of record as of November 9, 2020. With that, let's open the call to questions.\",\n",
       "    'Thank you, Luca. We ask you that you limit yourself to two questions. Operator, may we have the first question, please?',\n",
       "    'Questions & Answers:',\n",
       "    \"Certainly. We'll hear first today from Shannon Cross, Cross Research.\",\n",
       "    \"Thank you very much. Tim, can you talk a bit more about China? And in terms of linearity, I think, Luca, you'd mentioned that services in all regions were at an all-time high. I'm not sure exactly what your comment was. But maybe give us a little idea of whether you're seeing any blowback or benefit from the Huawei situation and just dig a bit more into the trends you're seeing in China.\",\n",
       "    'And then, I have a follow-up. Thank you.',\n",
       "    'A little more color on last quarter. We had a much more significant inventory drawdown on the channel side than other regions. And so that is one reason why the numbers are different than other regions. And additionally, the new products in the year-ago quarter were a higher percentage of our iPhone sales than they were in other regions.',\n",
       "    \"So hopefully, that explains what's going on in China. In terms of the market there, 5G is fairly advanced there. They're forecasting 600,000 base stations by the end of the year, and so we're entering the market at a very good time. And with the reception that we've gotten so far, we're very confident there.\",\n",
       "    \"Yeah, we're working hard to provide the best experience for our iPhone users. To do so, we've been collaborating closely with carriers all around the world to ensure iPhone has great throughput and coverage and battery and call quality. We've completed 5G testing so far on over 100 carriers, in over 30 regions. And so it's pretty pervasive around the world.\",\n",
       "    'Thanks, Shannon.',\n",
       "    'Thank you.',\n",
       "    'Thank yoyou. Can we have the next question, please?',\n",
       "    'That will be from Jeriel Ong with Deutsche Bank.',\n",
       "    'Yes, thank you so much. I guess, I appreciate the guidance for revenues to grow. But I guess, my question, perhaps if I could, is relative to seasonality. You guys, over the last five years, your seasonality is typically up about 50% quarter on quarter.',\n",
       "    'Do you think that you can beat that even with the later release? And I have a follow-up.',\n",
       "    \"So as I said, Jeriel, we're not providing a range for the reasons that I explained during my prepared remarks. So you need to keep in mind a couple of things that are unique about this quarter versus the past. And then, I mentioned again, the launch timing of the phones is different from the past. So we're launching the new iPhones four weeks into the quarter for two models, for the 12 and the 12 Pro; and seven weeks into the quarter for the other two, the iPhone mini and the 12 Pro Max.\",\n",
       "    \"So that is something to keep in mind as you think about the growth rates. With regard to all the other product categories, as I said, we are expecting to grow double digits essentially across the board for the rest of our products and for services. And so we are incredibly optimistic about what we are seeing so far. Obviously, we started taking preorders five days ago, and so it's a bit early for the phone.\",\n",
       "    \"But we think that there are a lot of tailwinds this year for iPhone, for the entire cycle, some of the comments that Tim has already made, right? We've got the best lineup of iPhones that we've ever had. We've got an installed base of iPhone that is very large, continues to grow. It's at an all-time high. Obviously, 5G is a once-in-a-decade opportunity.\",\n",
       "    \"And as you've seen in some markets, certainly here in the United States, carrier offers are very aggressive. And so that is very good for consumers and ultimately very good for us. So very, very optimistic, given what we've seen so far.\",\n",
       "    \"Awesome. Thank you so much for that context and giving us some of the levers to think about. I'd like to ask a little bit more of a strategic one, a little bit longer term in nature. I think the one thing that's interesting about the Apple One bundle is the desire to bundle in the first place.\",\n",
       "    \"I guess, I'm wondering, and some investors have asked me this as well, is that why wouldn't you also take that rationale perhaps to hardware, perhaps maybe AirPods and iPhone or AirPods, Watch and iPhone? Because if it makes sense to bundle services, wouldn't it also make sense to bundle hardware? And if that's not the case, then are there benefits of services bundling that don't necessarily translate to hardware bundling? Thanks.\",\n",
       "    \"Yes, we don't have anything to announce today on a hardware bundle. But backing up a bit, and we do view that people like to pay for their hardware, or at least some substantial portion of it, monthly. And so that's the reason that we have implemented installments in our stores and online. And that's the reason you see in some of the channels, too, selling a hardware on a per month kind of basis.\",\n",
       "    \"That begins to look like subscription perhaps to some buyers because they're used to holding the phone for X period of time and then turning it over and using the residual value of that phone in a way that gives them a de facto kind of subsidy on a new phone. And so there is something today in the market that works somewhat similar. On the services side, we had customers coming to us and asking for an easier way to buy all of our services, and we wanted to provide that, and we're looking forward to tomorrow to getting Apple One out there. Thank you for the question.\",\n",
       "    'Thank you, Jeriel. Can we have the next question, please?',\n",
       "    'It will come from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley.',\n",
       "    'Thank you. Good afternoon. New technologies, including the chips that support 5G, put upward pressure on cost this year, but you managed to leave ASPs for iPhones relatively unchanged this product cycle. How should we think about the margin profile of iPhone 12 relative to past iPhone cycles?',\n",
       "    \"Hi, Katy, obviously, we don't provide any outlook at the gross margin level for product categories. What I said in my prepared remarks, we expect gross margins in total for the company to be pretty much in line with what we've seen during the last quarter, which, obviously, as you said, it's very good, right, because we are offering the new phones at price points that are essentially unchanged, and we're taking on a lot of new technology into the phones. I would say the commodity environment is good. For the first time in many, many quarters, I don't have to say that foreign exchange is a headwind getting into the quarter.\",\n",
       "    \"It's not going to be a factor during the quarter. As we've made clear in our comments, we are bullish about our sales performance expectations, so we should be getting some leverage. And so I think the gross margin dynamics are good, and it's very good to see that we're able to offer so much more technology and still able to deliver the level of gross margins that I think investors are expecting.\",\n",
       "    \"OK. And shifting to the services business. This isn't dependent on certainly any one service, but licensing and other historically has been a driver of growth. That's where the ad-based revenue comes in.\",\n",
       "    \"When you think about the Google antitrust pressure, what's the risk that you see some shrinkage in your licensing and other segment within services? And do you see opportunities for other services to make up for any potential weakness?\",\n",
       "    \"We've got, Katy, as you know, we've announced a number of services over the last couple of years. And we are ramping those between Apple TV Plus and Apple News Plus and Apple Arcade. We've got Apple Card. We've got Apple Fitness Plus coming.\",\n",
       "    \"We've got a number of services that have been launched a bit longer that are doing really well from the App Store to iCloud. And so there's a lot of room there and potential there. I have no idea how the DOJ suit will go, but I think it's a long way from a conclusion on it.\",\n",
       "    'Thanks Katy. Can we have the next question, please?',\n",
       "    \"That will come from Evercore's Amit Daryanani.\",\n",
       "    \"Thanks for taking my question. I guess, I have two as well. First off, Tim, on iPhones, you talked about the iPhone installed base, I think, being the highest or largest it's ever been. Satisfaction rate is, obviously, pretty high.\",\n",
       "    \"And our data would suggest replacement cycles are getting elongated. And if I take all of that together, along with the fact that if iPhone users are like me with embarrassingly high weekly usage rates, does that, in aggregate, give you better confidence, better clarity that we could enter an extensive period of iPhone revenue growth versus what we've seen in the last couple of years?\",\n",
       "    'Got it. And then, I guess, Luca, I had a follow-up for you on the services gross margins, which have kind of continued to move higher rather nicely. I mean, do you think these levels at 67% essentially are sustainable? And what do you think are the two or three factors that are enabling these gross margins to remain here as we go forward?',\n",
       "    \"I mean, obviously, we're very pleased with the level of gross margins in services. As you said, they've been expanding almost 300 basis points on a year-over-year basis. The reason for that is, of course, that we are growing the services revenue and therefore, we are getting leverage on a lot of these services, right? Some of it, as explained in the past, we have a portfolio of services that got different margin profiles. And so sometimes depending on the mix of products we have, we can see margin expansion through mix as well.\",\n",
       "    \"But we're also launching new services that where we need to invest heavily upfront. But we think we've been able to show, for example, this year that we've launched a lot of new services, made all the necessary investments and still being able to expand gross margin. So we feel quite confident about the trajectory that we have for services. And we're very, very happy to see the customer response to really all of them because, as we've mentioned earlier, I mean, we've seen revenue records across essentially every category and across the entire world, right? We've seen September quarter records in every geography around the world.\",\n",
       "    'So all the dynamics, all the levers that we have in the services business are working very well right now. And that translates also into margin, of course.',\n",
       "    'Thanks, Amit. Next question, please?',\n",
       "    \"We'll hear from Samik Chatterjee with JP\\xa0Morgan.\",\n",
       "    \"Hi, thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to start off with the iPhone lineup here, particularly, as you mentioned, the carrier subsidies that you're seeing makes you optimistic about iPhone sales. I think just looking at some other factors here, earlier in the year, you had mentioned that iPhone sales were seeing an uptick with stimulus checks going out to consumers, helping in the consumer spending overall here in the U.S. So as we see some delays here on that front, are you seeing anything change on the consumer spending side? Is the macro impacting how you think about iPhone sales, particularly even with the new product lineup? And I have a follow-up.\",\n",
       "    'Thank you.',\n",
       "    \"Prior to mid-September, we were seeing double-digit growth in customer demand on iPhone. So there's a lot of momentum there, and there is a lot of momentum even much more so now given the launch of the 12 Pro and the iPhone 12. If you're asking whether it could have been even more with a different macro spending environment, I believe the answer to be yes. But you can't run the experiment, and so I don't know for sure.\",\n",
       "    'But I suspect that just the COVID, in general, takes something off from a worldwide economic point of view.',\n",
       "    \"And of course, the online store has stayed up and running through the whole of this. I think if you take some of those, the channel is doing some similar things and then some different things as well. And so I think everybody, to the best of their ability, is putting in contingency plans and finding a way to adapt to the environment. But it is difficult to call, and there's a level of uncertainty in it, obviously, and that's what Luca was referring to earlier.\",\n",
       "    'Thanks, Samik. Can we have the next question, please?',\n",
       "    'That will come from Krish Sankar with Cowen and Company.',\n",
       "    \"Hi, thanks for taking my question. I had two of them. First one, for Luca. I understand you don't want to give color on gross margin by product or segment.\",\n",
       "    \"But Luca, you mentioned gross margin should be similar in December versus September, and services should grow around double digits. There's a general view that on the iPhone side, the BOM cost would be a headwind for gross margin, but the carrier subsidies would be a tailwind. So I'm kind of curious, how should we think about the different like gross margin levels into December quarter? And then, I had a follow-up for Tim.\",\n",
       "    \"Yes. So typically, during the December quarter, we have positive factors because we have the typical seasonal leverage, right, sequentially as we go from September to the holiday season. And we also have an improved mix between products, particularly this year, as we've launched the new iPhone. At the same time, we shouldn't forget that we have launched a lot of new products during the last several weeks.\",\n",
       "    'We launched four new models of iPhone. We launched new models of Apple Watch, new models of iPad. And so clearly, every time we launch a new product, the cost structure is higher, and so that is going to be the other side of the coin. But we think that those two things should balance out.',\n",
       "    \"And again, as I was saying earlier, we are accomplishing this while delivering a lot of new technologies, a lot of new features to our customers. This time, foreign exchange is not a factor, and that's something that is a bit different from the past. But those are the pluses and minuses.\",\n",
       "    \"Got it. That's very helpful, Luca. And then, a follow-up for Tim. Tim, was kind of surprised, you didn't say a lot about the payments ecosystem in these prepared comments.\",\n",
       "    \"Kind of curious to find out from your vantage point how you think of your whole payment ecosystem, including Apple Card, Apple Pay, Apple Cash and how you're disaggregating the whole fintech environment.\",\n",
       "    \"Thanks for the question. There's just a limited number of things I can talk about, it's kind of the reason I didn't talk about it. We continue to be very enthusiastic about the whole payment services area. Apple Card is doing well, and Apple Pay is doing exceptionally well.\",\n",
       "    \"And so we are very bullish about this area and view that there are more things that Apple can do in this space. And so it's an area of great interest to us.\",\n",
       "    'Thanks, Krish. Can we have the next question, please?',\n",
       "    'That will come from Kyle McNealy with Jefferies.',\n",
       "    \"Hi, thanks for the question. I wanted to ask a little bit about the supply chain, given your later start for manufacturing for the flagship phone lineup this year. Do you think that supply will be able to meet demand through the end of the calendar year? And are there any component shortages that you're seeing? Or are there any actions that you can take to increase weekly output versus last year? Thanks.\",\n",
       "    \"Yes. Kyle, I don't know if you're talking about iPhone in particular. But if you look at iPhone, we are constrained today, and that's not a surprise, we are at the front end of the ramp, if you will. And how long we will be supply constrained, it's hard to predict.\",\n",
       "    \"We're supply constrained on iPad, and we're supply constrained on some Apple Watches as well. And so we have a fair number of areas right now of focus, and we're working really, really hard to remedy those as quickly as we can. But at this point, I can't estimate when we'll be out of that.\",\n",
       "    \"OK, great. Thanks a lot. And then, switching to Mac and iPad. How do you think about the durability of the strength you're seeing there with Mac and iPad? Is there any potential for stronger-than-seasonal pullback after the strong back-to-school season and holiday season? And the supply constraints make it feel like there's a good chance for continuation of the strong demand trends and flow-through of that.\",\n",
       "    'What should we think about the seasonality into the December and March quarter, being more positive than seasonal or less positive than seasonal? Thanks.',\n",
       "    \"And so that was an invariably part of it. But I think the other part of the remote work thing is not something that's going to step back to the way it used to be anytime soon.\",\n",
       "    'Great thanks very much.',\n",
       "    'Thank you. Can we have the next question, please?',\n",
       "    'That will come from Chris Caso with Raymond James.',\n",
       "    'Yes, thank you. I guess, first question is on iPhone pricing. There were some changes in the iPhone price back this year. The iPhone price point for iPhone 12 moved up a bit.',\n",
       "    \"And I guess, the difference, the gap between 12 and 12 Pro is smaller. And I guess, that's after you made some adjustments years prior where the price points came down a bit. Can you talk through the thought process behind that and the potential implications for either unit elasticity or blended ASP as a result of the price changes?\",\n",
       "    \"But I would guess that people are viewing it more as a $300 difference between the 12 mini and the 12 Pro. And so we'll see what the mix turns out. Right now, we have no data other than 12 and 12 Pro. We lack the data on the 12 mini and the Pro Max because we're not taking orders yet.\",\n",
       "    \"But what we try to always do in pricing is give the customer a great value, and I feel like we really did that this year. And that's despite, as was mentioned earlier, all of the extra features that we placed into the phones, including 5G. Thanks for the question.\",\n",
       "    \"All right. As a follow-up, you mentioned some of the carrier incentives we've seen here in the U.S. And if you could provide some more color about that, about what you're seeing now. And obviously, as we went through years ago, the incentives from carriers were a lot larger.\",\n",
       "    \"Does this mark some shift in the approach of carriers as we're moving into 5G? What's the extent of the permanence of some of these incentives? And then, as 5G rolls out around the world into other geographies, is this something we should expect that as either they try to protect from switchers or kind of promote the 5G networks, we'll see a higher prevalence of incentives from carriers as we go forward?\",\n",

       "    'Thanks, Tejas. Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for joining the call today. Before we begin, I join the many millions across this country in mourning and memorializing Congressman John Lewis who was laid to rest earlier today.',\n",
       "    \"We've lost a hero who walked among us, a leader in the truest sense who urged this country to aim higher and be better until the very end. I was humbled and fortunate to know him, and as an Alabama native, his example inspires me still. It now falls to every American to be a living memorial to John Lewis and to carry forward the work and the mission that defined his life. Throughout the call, I'll speak in greater detail about Apple's support for equity and justice, topics of great urgency on a number of fronts, but first, I want to pull the lens back to consider the quarter in full.\",\n",
       "    \"In an uncertain environment, Apple saw a quarter of historic results, demonstrating the important role our products play in our customers' lives. We set a June quarter record with revenue of $59.7 billion, up 11% from a year ago. Both products and Services set June quarter records and grew double digits, and revenue grew in each of our geographic segments, reflecting the broad base of this success. As always and especially in times of real adversity, what makes us proud as a company is not merely what we did but how we did it.\",\n",
       "    \"As millions marched for justice in big cities and small towns alike, we committed $100 million to launch Apple's Racial Equity and Justice Initiative as well as new and renewed internal efforts to foster diversity and inclusion at all levels of the company. As COVID-19 continues to represent great risk for individuals and great uncertainty for our communities, care and adaptability are defining how we conduct our work, wherever we work. In some places, that has meant responsibly reopening our operations in retail stores with enhanced health and safety precautions. In others where the virus has reemerged, it's meant taking the challenging but necessary step of reclosing stores.\",\n",
       "    \"I'll touch on these topics more in a little bit, but first, I want to offer some more context on the quarter's results. Due to the uncertain and ongoing impacts of COVID-19, we did not provide our typical guidance when we reported our results last quarter, but we did provide some color on how we expected the June quarter to play out. I'd like to contextualize our results in terms of that color across each of our product categories beginning with iPhone. iPhone revenue grew 2% this quarter.\",\n",
       "    'In April, we expected year-over-year performance to worsen but we saw better-than-expected demand in May and June. We attribute this increase in demand to several interactive causes, including a strong iPhone SE launch, continued economic stimulus and potentially some benefit from shelter-in-place restrictions lifting around the world. We expected iPad and Mac growth to accelerate, and we saw very strong double-digit growth for these devices this quarter. This remarkable performance came in spite of supply constraints on both products.',\n",
       "    \"We're working hard to get more iPads and Macs into customers' hands as quickly as possible, recognizing how integral they have become to working and learning from home, providing entertainment and staying connected with loved ones. Wearables growth decelerated as we expected but still grew by strong double digits and set a revenue record for a non-holiday quarter. Building on powerful new features built into WatchOS 7 and AirPods Pro announced this quarter, we are very excited about the many opportunities in front of us for this product category. These strong results helped drive our installed base of active devices to new all-time records across each of our product categories.\",\n",
       "    'Reflecting the deep integration of hardware, software and Services. Services generated a June quarter record of $13.2 billion, up 15% year over year. As we mentioned during our last call, there were two distinct trends we were seeing and they played out as we thought: First, results for advertising and AppleCare were impacted by the reduced level of economic activity and store closures to a degree that was in line with our expectations. Second, we had strong performance in our digital Services with all-time revenue records in the App Store, Apple Music, video and cloud Services as well as elevated engagement on iMessage, Siri and FaceTime months.',\n",
       "    \"Customers are loving new offerings across Apple's Services, like Apple News Today, our new daily audio briefing, and Greyhound, our new summer blockbuster starring Tom Hanks. In fact, Apple TV+ just hit a history-making 95 awards nominations and 25 wins and accolades. Based on these results and our performance over the last four quarters, we are proud to announce that we have achieved our goal of doubling our fiscal 2016 Services Revenue six months ahead of schedule. We're conscious of the fact that these results stand in stark relief during a time of real economic adversity for businesses large and small and certainly for families.\",\n",
       "    \"We do not have a zero-sum approach to prosperity, and especially in times like this, we're focused on growing the pie, making sure our success isn't just our success and that everything we make, build or do is geared toward creating opportunities for others. The App Store is a great example. This quarter, a new study by independent economists at the Analysis Group found that the App Store facilitated more than $0.5 trillion in commerce globally in 2019 alone. Especially in a time of COVID-19, you can measure economic resilience in the ways in which the App Store supports remote ordering for restaurants, digital commerce for small businesses and an enduring entrepreneurial opportunity for creators and visionaries.\",\n",
       "    \"Keeping learning vibrant and impactful in the time of COVID-19 is a priority everyone shares. Earlier this month, we announced significant enhancements to the Develop in Swift and Everyone Can Code curricula, and we launched a new professional learning course available exclusively to educators. And just two weeks ago, our community education initiative added 10 more historically black college and university regional coding centers to our roster, bringing the total to 24 locations nationwide, 12 of which are HBCUs and 21 of which serve majority black and brown student populations. In Apple's backyard, we announced that we're allocating $400 million of our multiyear $2.5 billion affordable housing commitment to new housing construction, homebuyer assistance programs and support for those at greatest risk of experiencing homelessness across Silicon Valley.\",\n",
       "    \"Apple's results this quarter are only possible due to our people and their ongoing ingenuity, flexibility, resilience and determination during these ever-changing times. I want to thank our AppleCare and retail teams, who have paired exceptional service during a time of intense demand with great adaptability during a quarter where stores have reopened in some places and reclosed in others. A dedicated team of specialists and experts has shouldered the task of caring for the well-being of our teams and communities, store by store, location by location with evidence-driven granularity and agility that is unrivaled anywhere. Innovation from adversity certainly defined this year's Worldwide Developers Conference as well.\",\n",
       "    \"This is an event where traditionally, Apple's worldwide community of developers gathers together to share, celebrate and do big things together. Though we could not be together in person, Apple set a new standard for what online events can achieve with our celebrated all-virtual event. The results here speak for themselves. More than 22 million viewers tuned in across all of Apple's streams.\",\n",
       "    \"For our developers, we distributed more than 72 hours of video content. That's three full days of video. The week saw more than 200 direct-to-video engineering and design sessions and about 4,500 person-to-person appointments with developers across 227 virtual labs. And of course, that's even before you get to this year's announcements.\",\n",
       "    \"From iOS 14, which boasts a radical redesign to the Home Screen, powerful updates to Messages, streamlined and effortless App Clips and even greater privacy transparency and controls to major updates to Apple Pencil, Siri and calling in iPadOS 14, to much anticipated sleep tracking, new fitness and wellness features and unprecedented customization in watchOS 7, to the new macOS Big Sur boasting the biggest redesign upgrade to macOS since OS X. No less important for Apple's innovation road map is our transition to Apple Silicon for the Mac. This two-year effort will achieve both unprecedented performance for the Mac and a common architecture across all Apple products. Looking forward, we are profoundly optimistic about Apple's future.\",\n",
       "    \"And we recognize that with this success comes a real responsibility to lead with our values because those values help make that success possible in the first place. We are just as proud of our announcement this month that Apple will be fully carbon-neutral by 2030 across our entire supply chain and including the energy use of every device we make as we are of any hardware innovation because they spring from the same instinct to leave the world better than we found it. We're committed to standing with those marching for the lives and dignity through our new $100 million commitment to Apple's Racial Equity and Justice Initiative. And we're deepening our diversity and inclusion efforts internally because our future as a business is inextricably linked with the future of our communities.\",\n",
       "    \"There are times when things seem to move slowly when needed progress, economic or social, seems bogged down, when the instinct to turn away from the horizon and hold on to what you've got feels inescapable. And then there are times like this when people of goodwill step forward, when progress unmoors itself, when the insistence of hope forces something new. This is an immensely challenging moment. COVID-19 is still devastating many places, and we have work left to do to care for the health and well-being of the communities in which all of us live and work.\",\n",
       "    \"But no community of people, whether a company or a country, can afford to miss this call when it comes. At Apple, we never have and we don't intend to start now. With that, I'll hand things off to Luca.\",\n",
       "    \"Thank you, Tim. Good afternoon, everyone. Our June quarter was a testament to Apple's ability to innovate and execute during challenging times. Our results speak to the resilience of our business and the relevance of our products and Services in our customers' lives.\",\n",
       "    'Total revenue was $59.7 billion, a new June quarter record, up 11% from a year ago despite a 300 basis point headwind from foreign exchange. Our performance was strong across our entire portfolio as we grew revenue in each of our product categories and set June quarter records for Mac, for wearables and for Services. Similarly, our results were very strong all around the world, with growth in all geographic segments and new June quarter records in the Americas, in Europe, in Japan and rest of Asia Pacific. Products revenue was $46.5 billion, up 10% and a June quarter record.',\n",
       "    'iPhone returned to growth and we saw very strong double-digit growth from iPad, Mac and wearables. Lockdowns and point-of-sale closures were widespread during April and impacted our performance, but we saw demand for all products improve significantly in May and June. As a result of our strong performance and the unmatched loyalty of our customers, our installed base of active devices reached an all-time high in all of our geographic segments and all major product categories. Our Services continue to grow strongly, up 15% year over year and reached a June quarter record of $13.2 billion.',\n",
       "    \"We set all-time records in many Services categories and June quarter records in each geographic segment. I'll cover this in more detail later. Company gross margin was 38%. This was down 40 basis points sequentially due to unfavorable FX of 90 basis points and a different mix of products, partially offset by cost savings and Services mix.\",\n",
       "    'Products gross margin was 29.7%, decreasing 60 basis points sequentially due to FX and a different mix, partially offset by cost savings. Services gross margin was 67.2%, up 180 basis points sequentially mainly due to mix. Net income was $11.3 billion, and earnings per share were $2.58, up 18% and a June quarter record. Operating cash flow was also a June quarter record at $16.3 billion, an improvement of $4.6 billion over a year ago.',\n",
       "    'Let me get into more detail for each of our revenue categories. iPhone revenue grew 2% to $26.4 billion with customer demand improving as the quarter progressed. COVID-19 was most impactful during the first three weeks of April when lockdowns and point-of-sale closures became more widespread in many countries. We saw marked improvement around the world in May and June, which we attribute to an improved level of customer demand helped by the very successful launch of iPhone SE and economic stimulus packages.',\n",
       "    'Our active installed base of iPhones again reached an all-time high as a result of the loyalty of our customer base and strength of our ecosystem. In fact, in the U.S., the latest survey of consumers from 451 Research indicates iPhone customer satisfaction of 98% for iPhone 11, 11 Pro and 11 Pro Max combined. Turning to Services. As I said, we set a June quarter record of $13.4 billion of revenue.',\n",
       "    'We had all-time record performance and strong double-digit growth in the App Store, Apple Music, video and cloud services. Our new services, Apple TV+, Apple Arcade, Apple News+ and Apple Card, are also contributing to overall services growth and continue to add users, content and features. At the same time, customer engagement in our ecosystem continues to grow at a fast pace. The number of both transacting and paid accounts on our digital content stores reached a new all-time high during the June quarter, with paid accounts increasing double digits in each of our geographic segments.',\n",
       "    'In aggregate, paid subscriptions grew more than 35 million sequentially, and we now have over 550 million paid subscriptions across the Services on our platform, up 130 million from a year ago. With this momentum, we remain confident to reach our increased target of 600 million paid subscriptions before the end of calendar 2020. Wearables, Home and Accessories established a new June quarter record with revenue of $6.5 billion, up 17% year over year. Our wearables business is now the size of a Fortune 140 company, and we set June quarter records in the majority of markets we track.',\n",
       "    \"Importantly, Apple Watch continues to extend its reach, with over 75% of the customers purchasing Apple Watch during the quarter new to the product. Next, I'd like to talk about the impressive performance of Mac. Revenue was $7.1 billion, up 22% over last year and a June quarter record. We grew double digits in each geographic segment and set all-time revenue records in Japan and rest of Asia Pacific, as well as June quarter records in the Americas and Europe.\",\n",
       "    'Customer response to our new MacBook Air and MacBook Pro launches has been extremely strong. iPad performance was equally impressive with revenue of $6.6 billion, up 31% and our highest June quarter revenue in eight years. Demand was strong around the world with double-digit growth in each of our geographic segments, including a June quarter record in Greater China. The launch of our new iPad Pro has been received incredibly well in every region of the world.',\n",
       "    'Both Mac and iPad are extremely relevant products in the new working and learning environments, and the most recent surveys of consumers from 451 Research measured customer satisfaction at 96% for Mac and 97% for iPad. Around half of the customers purchasing Mac and iPad during the quarter were new to that product, and as a result, the active installed base for both products reached a new all-time high. Our retail business had record June quarter revenue, thanks to the performance of our online store. We set records in all geographic segments and grew across all major product categories.',\n",
       "    \"In June, we launched Apple Card monthly installments for more products in our U.S. stores, allowing customers to pay for their devices over time with 0% interest. We're very pleased with the level of customer interest this new offering has generated. In the enterprise market, we continue to see companies leverage Apple products and offerings to successfully navigate their businesses through COVID-19.\",\n",
       "    \"In healthcare, we're seeing rapid acceleration of telehealth to support a more flexible model of patient care. Many hospitals, such as UVA Health, Rush University Medical Center and UC San Diego Health are using apps on iPad and iPhone to help triage, monitor and care for patients who are at home. This helps free up hospital capacity to support patients who need inpatient care while enabling continued care for patients who do not require in-person visits. Since many call center employees are currently working remotely, Apple Business Chat has proven an invaluable tool for staying connected with customers.\",\n",
       "    'This quarter, HSBC deployed Apple Business Chat in its U.S. and U.K. contact centers. Apple Business Chat provides a flexible and secure channel for digital banking assistance through a native Apple experience, improving the efficiency and experience for both customers and agents.',\n",
       "    'We are seeing similar adoption by hundreds of other organizations. Let me now turn to our cash position. We ended the quarter with almost $194 billion in cash plus marketable securities. We issued $8.5 billion of new term debt, retired $7.4 billion of term debt and increased short-term borrowing facilities by $1.1 billion during the quarter, leaving us with total debt of $113 billion.',\n",
       "    'As a result, net cash was $81 billion at the end of the quarter, and we continue on our path to reaching a net cash neutral position over time. We returned over $21 billion to shareholders during the June quarter, including $3.7 billion in dividends and equivalents and $10 billion through open market repurchases of 31.3 million Apple shares. We also began a $6 billion accelerated share repurchase program in May, resulting in the initial delivery and retirement of 15.2 million shares. And finally, we retired an additional 4.8 million shares in the final settlement of our 15th ASR.',\n",
       "    \"As we move ahead into the September quarter, I'd like to provide some color on what we are seeing, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Tejas referred to at the beginning of the call. Similar to last quarter, given the uncertainty around the world in the near term, we will not be issuing revenue and margin guidance for the coming quarter. However, we will provide some additional insight on our expectations for the September quarter for our product categories. On iPhone, we expect to see recent performance continue for our current product lineup, including the strong customer response for iPhone SE.\",\n",
       "    'In addition, as you know, last year, we started selling new iPhones in late September. This year, we project supply to be available a few weeks later. We expect the rest of our products categories to have strong year-over-year performance. For Services, we expect the September quarter to have the same trends that we observed during the June quarter except for AppleCare, where during the September quarter a year ago, we expanded our distribution significantly.',\n",
       "    'As a consequence, we expect a difficult comp for AppleCare also considering the COVID-related point-of-sale closures this year. For gross margin, keep in mind that we will have a different mix than in prior years, as I just explained. For opex, we expect to be between $9.8 billion and $9.9 billion. We expect the tax rate to be about 16.5% and OI&E to be $50 million.',\n",
       "    \"Also today, our board of directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.82 per share of common stock payable on August 13, 2020, to shareholders of record as of August 10, 2020. And finally, today, we're announcing a four-for-one split of Apple common stock to make our stock more accessible to a broader base of investors. Each shareholder of record at the close of business on August 24, 2020, will receive three additional shares for every outstanding share held on the record date, and trading will begin on a split-adjusted basis on August 31, 2020.

       "    'Operator, may we please have the first question?',\n",
       "    'Yes. That will be from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley.',\n",
       "    \"Thank you. Good afternoon Tim, in light of the economic adversity that you talked about in the prepared remarks, can you just walk us through how Apple's leveraging finance and trade-in programs to make technology more affordable and accessible during this period while also addressing the opportunity to recycle and reuse products and maybe also extend that to how these programs might expand over time? And then I have a follow-up.\",\n",
       "    \"As Luca mentioned, in June, we actually rolled out to the overwhelming balance of our other products the ability to do interest-free financing in our stores with payments. And that's in addition to trade-in, which is becoming a more common trend now, which I think is terrific because it is great for the environment and it acts as a subsidy, if you will, against the price of a new phone. And so when you compound these two things with the financing and the trade-in, it makes the product super affordable. And we're really happy with what we're seeing in that regard.\",\n",
       "    'And then as a follow-up, just specifically to iPhone, the category returned to growth. As you pointed out, the installed base is larger today. Our math would suggest that replacement cycles, in some cases, are elongated. And then you have the affordability element that you just discussed.',\n",
       "    \"Does all of that combine to build confidence that we're entering a longer period of iPhone revenue growth after what's been six quarters of decline?\",\n",
       "    \"We're very pleased with how we did on iPhone. It was better than we thought largely because, as we pointed out in the prepared remarks, May and June were much better. If you look at iPhone in totality, the things that get me very optimistic is the size of the active installed base. The fact that if you look in the major geographies like the U.S., we had the top two selling smartphones.\",\n",
       "    'In the U.K., we had three of the top four. In Australia, we had five of the top six. And in Japan, we had the top four. Urban China, iPhone 11 was the top-selling smartphone in the country.',\n",
       "    \"And so these are some very different geographies with very different competitive situations and we're doing fairly well. The iPhone SE, it's also clear that from the early data, we're seeing a higher switcher number than we did in the previous year, which we feel very good about. And it also seemed to appeal to some people that were holding onto the device a little longer because they wanted a smaller form factor phone. And so the combination of the smaller form factor and an incredibly affordable price made the iPhone SE very popular.\",\n",
       "    'iPhone 11 is still the most popular smartphone, but iPhone SE definitely helped our results. And as Lucas said in his outlook, we do see that continuing into this quarter currently.',\n",
       "    'Thank you. Congrats on the quarter.',\n",
       "    'Thank you so much. Do we have the next question please?',\n",
       "    'Yes. That will be from Krish Sankar with Cowen and Company.',\n",
       "    \"I have two of them. First one, Tim, when you look at the Services business and in terms of your TV+ content production, have the movement restrictions impacted the content production efforts? And along the same path, four years ago, your premonition on Services being a $50 billion business in 2020 came sooner than expected. I don't know if you want to make any such forecast four years out on how you think Services revenue is going to be. Then I had a follow-up for Luca.\",\n",
       "    \"I'm sorry. I missed that second question because the audio didn't come through. But I think, just to the first, and that is production has been affected for Apple TV+, as I think it has for most people. We are working to get restarted.\",\n",
       "    \"I don't have a precise date yet when we will get restarted, but there will be some impact because we shut down in the March time frame and are yet to really restart in a significant way particularly for those that are shot in the L.A. area given the current status of the virus in this and I'm sorry, I missed the second part of your question.\",\n",
       "    'Well, Tim, I was trying to see. four years ago, you made a great prediction that Services is going to be $50 billion by 2020. I wanted to see if you have any update to the prediction four years down the road.',\n",
       "    \"We're not updating today. We feel good. We want to take the moment and feel good about achieving the doubling six months early. And we do have, still hanging out there, as you know, the subscription number that we're shooting for later in the year at 600 million.\",\n",
       "    'So we do have that objective out there.',\n",
       "    'OK. If I could just squeeze in one for Luca. With the strong sales in Mac given the shelter in place, do you think the back-to-school season got pulled in by a quarter? Or do you expect the momentum to still continue?',\n",
       "    \"So we expect the performance that we've seen for Mac in the June quarter to continue.\",\n",
       "    'Thank you.',\n",
       "    'Can we have the next question please?',\n",
       "    \"From Cross Research, we'll hear from Shannon Cross.\",\n",
       "    \"Thank you very much. Tim, can you talk a bit about what you're seeing in China? I know the revenue was up 2%, and I think Luca talked about record iPad. But just curious given their 5G is a bit ahead, how you're seeing the market play out? And then I have a follow-up.\",\n",
       "    \"Thank you Shannon, we did see growth in Greater China for the quarter of 2%. Currency affected China a bit more than in other places. It affected 400 basis points, and so in constant currency, we would have grown at 6%. As I'd mentioned before, the iPhone 11 has been our best-selling phone and has been no.\",\n",
       "    \"one in Urban China, and so we're very, very proud of that. iPad was helped in the June quarter there by the work-from-home and distance learning as it was in other geographies, and the Mac also grew strong double digit during the quarter. And Services set a new June quarter record there. We also continue to see extremely high new customer rates on Mac and iPad there.\",\n",
       "    \"To give you a perspective, about three out of four customers that are buying the Mac are new in China, and about two out of three that are buying the iPad are new. And so these are numbers that we're super proud of.\",\n",
       "    \"Great. And then can you talk a little bit more about the decision to bring Mac silicon in-house and the benefits that you expect to see or you've seen from vertical integration of acquisitions like the Intel modem business? Thanks.\",\n",
       "    \"Yes. I mean what at we'll wind up with is a common architecture across all of our products, which gives us some interesting things that we can do in products that it sort of unleashes another round of innovation. And so I don't want to say a lot about it other than we're extremely excited about it. It's something that we've worked on quite a while to get to this point, and we're looking forward to shipping the first Mac with Apple Silicon later in the year.\",\n",
       "    'Thank you Shannon. We have the next question please.',\n",
       "    'That will come from Amit Daryanani with Evercore.',\n",
       "    \"Thanks for taking the question guys. I have one and a follow-up as well. So first one, I guess, Tim, if I think about the strength you're seeing with iPhones right now, do you have a sense in terms of where is this trend coming from? Is it more replacement cycles getting shorter? Or are we just getting new customers into the iOS ecosystem? Because clearly, these growth rates seem fairly impressive in the context of a pandemic and the upcoming refresh cycle that we have.\",\n",
       "    \"I think, Amit, it's a combination of a strong launch with iPhone SE and in probably some pickup because of the economic stimulus that hit different countries at different points in time and probably some of the reopening that took place across the quarter, particularly in May and June, as stores started to reopen. And so it's a combination of all of those. And as you know, we've been having a strong cycle with the iPhone 11 and the 11 Pro. And so when you combine a strong cycle plus an iPhone SE launch plus the reopening of the stores, et cetera, I think there were a lot of things that were going in the right direction there.\",\n",
       "    \"Perfect. That's helpful. And I guess, Luca, if I could just follow up with you. I'd love to get your perspective on how do we think about the overall 38% gross margins.\",\n",
       "    'What do you think are the levers to improve this as you go forward, not really September quarter but over the next one or two years? And in that context, do you see a point where the product gross margins start to stabilize because they have been trending somewhat lower for the last couple of quarters now?',\n",
       "    \"Yes. Let me start with what we've seen during the June quarter. At 38%, we were down slightly sequentially but up the same amount on a year-over-year basis. And really, the big negative impact that we felt for several quarters now has been the strength of the U.S.\",\n",
       "    \"dollar. So the foreign exchange impact on a sequential basis was 90 basis points, on a year-over-year basis was 130 basis points. So obviously, that is something to keep in mind. And then the other aspect, I think it's always important to keep in mind, Amit, is that we sell many different products.\",\n",
       "    \"They have different margin profiles. And so sometimes, a different mix can have an impact on the aggregate level of products' gross margins. And we're very pleased to see the performance of Mac, iPad and wearables, but obviously, it's a different mix. Going forward, the variables are always the same.\",\n",
       "    \"The foreign exchange will continue to play an impact. The mix of products that we're going to be selling will have an impact as well. The commodities market has been relatively benign, and we'll see how that plays out over time. As you know now for several years, we've been managing gross margin, I would say, fairly well in spite of some difficult situations like the one with the strength of the dollar, and we plan to continue to make good trade-off decisions between revenue and units and margins.\",\n",
       "    'Thank you.',\n",
       "    'Can we have the next question please?',\n",
       "    'That will come from Kyle McNealy with Jefferies.',\n",
       "    \"Hi. Thanks a lot for the question. Our team in Asia, recently, we did some survey work on smartphones in China. It showed that there's still a high proportion of the installed bases on six, seven and eight devices.\",\n",
       "    \"I know you talked about the trade-in programs and promotions that you've been doing there. I wonder if you can tell us whether there's anything else that you're doing to get these customers into your latest technology. What might those customers be looking for? And how should we think about when an upgrade cycle might come on more strongly there in China?\",\n",
       "    \"Customers upgrade at a different pace, and I don't have in front of me the exact installed base data from China. But I mean much like in other geographies, the upgrades have extended some. It extended some during the depths, if you will, of the pandemic in China and the rest of the world and probably, to some degree, is happening still at this point. The key things that we can do is keep innovating, deliver a product that people can't imagine going through life without and obviously keep rolling out these programs that make the front-end purchase be much less.\",\n",
       "    'And this is things like the financing and the trade-in programs that you mentioned. And I do feel like those are going quite good in a number of geographies.',\n",
       "    'OK. Great. Thanks. And one more, if I may.',\n",
       "    \"Congrats again on the strong iPad and Mac results. That's really impressive. I guess the obvious question is, should we ever think about how much of that might be pulled forward and what might it do to future upgrades in the next two years? Anything else you can share on how you think about growth from here or whether there's a hangover period maybe after the back-to-school season or holiday season, that would be helpful.\",\n",
       "    \"The installed base is growing, and the new customer numbers that Luca went over in the aggregate are still very high close to 50% kind of range. And so that, to me, bodes well for the future. There's as we had indicated, there's some amount of work from home and remote learning that do affect the results of Mac and iPad positively. They probably affect wearables and iPhone the other direction but on Mac and iPad, these are productivity tools that people are using to stay engaged with their work or stay engaged with their school work.\",\n",
       "    \"And we believe we're going to have a strong back-to-school season. Sitting here today, it certainly looks like that. Thank you Kyle.\",\n",

       "    \"That will come from Cleveland Research's Ben Bollin.\",\n",
       "    'Good evening everyone. Thanks for taking the question. Tim, I was hoping you could share a little bit about where you think channel inventory is. You talked about the tightness you saw exiting the June quarter for Mac and iPad.',\n",
       "    'Interested where you think inventory is across major product categories. And then I had a follow-up for Luca.',\n",
       "    \"OK. And then, Luca, I'm interested. Any color you could share about the impact COVID had on opex in the quarter, be it work-from-home stipends, less travel, other employee support costs? And also, how the company is thinking about the longer-term opportunity of employees working remotely maybe more permanently and any considerations on how that could influence future opex. Thanks.\",\n",
       "    \"Well, on the opex front, there have been obviously certain things that have been affected in terms of cost reductions. Obviously, travel is a perfect example. The number of meetings that we had internally, some of those costs have been reduced. We've also invested heavily in initiatives.\",\n",
       "    \"For example, we're really trying to help during very difficult circumstances. For example, we have had a program, for example, where we match our employee donations. We made donations directly as a company around the world to many institutions and governments. On a net basis, I would say probably, the costs have outweighed the savings both during the March and the June quarter, but we think it's absolutely the right thing to do.\",\n",
       "    \"From an employee perspective, what we said so far is that here in the United States, the majority of our population will continue to work from home until the end of the year. And then we'll see. I mean we've taken an approach that we try to understand how the virus is evolving over time. We've taken a very cautious approach both with our corporate facilities and with our retail stores.\",\n",
       "    \"I think what you've seen with retail stores is that we have reopened in a number of geographies around the world. We've reopened here in the United States. We've had to reclose some of the stores here in the United States as the number of cases has gone up, and we will continue to track how the virus is doing. And hopefully, at some point, we're going to get to a point where there is a vaccine or there is a cure.\",\n",

       "    \"Yes. Thank you so much. I have two questions as well. I'd like to focus on the gross margin expansion within the Services line, all-time record for the quarter.\",\n",
       "    \"I'm just curious whether you think that will sustain. I understand within Services, there's a pretty wide range of gross margins by business, and I'm wondering if that should continue to improve.\",\n",
       "    \"Well, as you've seen, obviously, we've had a sequential expansion in gross margin for Services, and that was driven primarily by mix, as you said, right? We have a very broad portfolio. And depending on which one of the Services does better, then we have an impact on Services gross margins. We like the Services business because it's a recurring type of revenue and the margins are accretive to company margin. We did over 67% this quarter.\",\n",
       "    \"But we want to offer very competitive Services across the board, and the I think I'm going to make the same comments that I made on products. What matters to us is to be successful with everything that we do and provide great products and Services to our customers. So the relative success of our products and Services in the marketplace will drive, to a certain extent, what our margins are. The margins are a by-product of our success in the marketplace.\",\n",
       "    \"Got it. I really appreciate that. And I wanted to ask a question on the wearables segment. It seems to me that you're categorizing the wearables business as maybe being a little bit impacted by pandemic similar to the iPhones.\",\n",
       "    \"And it's the first time that wearables hasn't materially upsided in at least a while in recent memory. I guess the drivers of wearables being predominantly Watch and AirPods, what are your thoughts going forward on whether there's a little bit of pent-up demand perhaps that might resume as we get back to a more normalized environment?\",\n",
       "    'I think on the Watch, in particular, is like the iPhone, more affected by store closures because some people want to try on the Watch and see what it looks like, look at different band choices and those sorts of things. So I think as stores closed, it puts more pressure on that. We did come out sort of the way we told you last quarter. We were going to come out from the color that we gave you.',\n",
       "    'So we knew things would decelerate because of the closures. So we wound up being very pleased with how we did, but the store closures definitely affect the wearables and the iPhone.',\n",
       "    'Thank you. Got it. Appreciate that. Yes.',\n",
       "    'Can we have the next question please?',\n",
       "    'That will come from Jim Suva with Citigroup.',\n",
       "    \"Thank you very much. And I have two questions. I'll ask them at the same time, and it's one for Tim and one for Luca. Tim, the coronavirus.\",\n",
       "    \"Your company has done a fantastic job at overcoming the hurdle. So congratulations to you. As you look forward, say, to the Christmas holiday shopping season and given the economic challenges around the world of where is coronavirus and your product launches and things like that, can you give any commentary maybe how this Christmas, you're looking forward to see maybe some past cycles of Christmas of a line-up? Because it just seems like it's a little bit different, but Apple is really showing a lot more strength coming into this Christmas than maybe some of the past years. And then for Luca.\",\n",
       "    \"I think today, a quick comment, Luca, you mentioned something about a few weeks later. Was that for like iPhone, iPhone chips or product launches? Or maybe expound upon that. I know things are more difficult but I didn't quite get the commentary. It was in your prepared comments, Luca, about a few weeks later.\",\n",
       "    \"Let's just do a quick little blurb.\",\n",
       "    \"Yes, we take it one quarter at a time, and so we'll give you a color on the December quarter in October. Generally speaking, I think we need to see a vaccine or therapeutic or both, and there's some optimism around that in that particular time frame. And so we'll see. I don't have any information that isn't publicly available there, but I think that would boost consumer confidence quite a bit if it began to happen.\",\n",
       "    'And I think that any kind of consumer stock company would benefit from that.',\n",
       "    'And Jim, on the iPhone, I said in my remarks a year ago, we launched the new iPhone in late September. So I was referring to the new product. And I said that this year, the supply of the new product will be a few weeks later than that.',\n",
       "    'Congratulations to you and your entire organization and teams.',\n",
       "    'Thank you very much. Can we have the next question please?',\n",
       "    'That will come from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America.',\n",
       "    'Thank you. I was wondering if you can maybe comment on the penetration of Apple Card users in the iOS installed base. And have you seen any change in the buying behavior of Apple Card users in terms of accelerating spend on more Apple products and Services? And I have a follow-up.',\n",
       "    \"We saw changes in consumer spending as the shutdowns occurred and as the store closures occurred. We could see that across the Card. It affected the categories that you would guess the most, like travel and entertainment, etc. But overall, if you sort of pull the lens out on the Apple Card, we're very happy with the number of people that have the Apple Card.\",\n",
       "    \"We believe, based on what we've heard, that it's the fastest rollout in the history of credit cards, and so we feel very good about that.\",\n",
       "    'OK, Tim. And as a follow-up, now that Apple has Apple silicon for Macs, would you ever consider monetizing this as a merchant Silicon vendor? Or is this going to be forever for Apple use?',\n",
       "    \"Well, I don't want to make a forever comment but we're a product company and we love making the whole thing and because we can own the user experience in that way and with the goal of delighting the user. And that's the reason that we're doing the Apple silicon is because we can envision some products that we can achieve with Apple Silicon that we couldn't achieve otherwise. And so that's how we look at it.\",\n",

       "    \"Today Apple reports $58.3 billion in revenue, an all-time record for services and a quarterly record for Wearables, Home and Accessories. It was also a quarterly revenue record for Apple Retail, powered by phenomenal growth in our online store. Amid the most challenging global environment in which we've ever operated our business, we are proud to say that Apple grew during the quarter.\",\n",
       "    \"But before we dive more deeply into the numbers, I want to speak just for a bit on COVID-19. This is something Apple has been contending with since January, and I think that how we have responded, what we have been inspired to do tells an important story about Apple's great durability as a business and the enduring importance of our products and our customers' lives. It also speaks to Apple's unmatched capacity to be creative, to think always in terms of the long term, and to forge ahead when others may feel an instinct to pull back.\",\n",
       "    \"Before COVID-19 was on the horizon, we anticipated that Q2 was going to be a prolific and energetic period for Apple. And when the pandemic did strike, our teams not only succeeded in growing the business in introducing powerful new products and in meeting our customers needs, but they also rose to the occasion in terms of meeting our broader obligations to the communities in which we live and work. Let's look quickly across the business.\",\n",
       "    \"At the same time that they were leaving no stone unturned to get our latest generation of devices manufactured and into our customers' hands, our worldwide network of supply chain partners, logistics and operations folks in every part of the company were also sourcing more than 30 million masks for frontline medical workers, ensuring they're donated to places of greatest need in every region around the world. While our product teams were preparing to launch a new iPad Pro, Magic Keyboard, MacBook Air and the new iPhone SE, all of which have been very well received by reviewers and consumers alike, they were also working with our suppliers to design, test, manufacture and distribute more than 7.5 million face shields, and we continue to ship more than 1 million of these every week to the doctors, nurses and medical personnel on the frontlines.\",\n",
       "    'In a quarter, where our Services teams achieved strong growth, which Luca will dig into in a minute and which speaks to the real durability of our services strategy, these teams were also putting COVID-19 front and center. As Apple News reached 125 million monthly active users, we elevated trusted information from reliable sources through a special COVID-19 vertical. We let customers skipped payments without incurring interests on Apple Card for March and April in light of financial hardship for many families. We worked with everyone from Oprah to Lady Gaga, to inform, entertain and give back through Apple TV. And services like FaceTime and Messages set new all-time records for daily volume during this quarter as users relied on their devices to stay connected in a new reality.',\n",
       "    \"We paired these programmatic efforts with a broader strategy to give back where it's needed most. We've made major corporate donations to response efforts around the world to support global citizen, as well as a new fund for Americans experiencing food and security as a result of the crisis. When you tally these things up and consider our ongoing two-to-one match for employee donations, Apple's contributions to the global response are significant, diverse and a great source of pride for the whole team. We're also doing what we can to help our employees, their families, and by extension their communities, stay safe and well by modifying our operations where appropriate. This extends of course to our retail employees. They're Apple's face to our customers and an instrumental part of our business, and we're compensating them normally despite store closures.\",\n",
       "    'During a quarter where circumstances evolve by the hour, we have been gratified by the resilience and adaptability of our global supply chain. While we felt some temporary supply constraints in February, our operations team, suppliers and manufacturing partners have been safely returning to work and production was back at typical levels toward the end of March. At this time of social distance, of shuttered schools and gathering places, of delayed plans and new ways of socializing, we have seen significant evidence that our products have taken a renewed importance for our customers. Teachers and students around the world are relying on our technology to teach, learn and stay connected with each other.',\n",
       "    \"We are in the process of deploying major orders of iPads to school systems working to keep learning going strong at a distance, including tens of thousands in Ontario, Canada, Glasgow, Scotland, and Puerto Rico, 100,000 into the city of Los Angeles, and 350,000 to New York City, our largest educational iPad deployment ever. Since early March, we've seen unprecedented demand for our Pro Apps from students, enthusiasts and creative professionals. These folks are keeping us all entertained and inspired as we stay at home, and to help them do it, we made Final Cut Pro X and Logic Pro X available for free for 90 days for everyone. And the reaction has been overwhelming driving software downloads and usage to record levels.\",\n",
       "    'And doctors and medical professionals are making even greater use of Apple Watch and other health features to communicate with patients and to treat them safely from a distance when necessary. With new FDA guidance on non-invasive remote patient monitoring for example, the ECG app on Apple Watch is increasingly being used to facilitate remote ECG measurements and recordings for telemedicine usage, reducing patient and healthcare provider contact and exposure. Many hospitals such as Geisinger Health System, NYU Langone Health and Stanford Health Care are using apps on iPad and iPhone to support communication and video conferences between hospitalized patients and their care teams. This enables the care teams to keep a close watch on patients without entering isolation rooms, which helps to minimize exposure and reduces some of the need for personal protective equipment.',\n",
       "    \"Now, when you step back and tally all this up, when you consider all the ways COVID-19 has touched Apple, our customers and the way we work, this may not have been the quarter it could have been absent this pandemic. But I don't think I can recall a quarter where I've been prouder of what we do or how we do it. As I said at the outset, we achieved revenue of $58.3 billion, and underneath that was product revenue of $45 billion. The performance of our product business had three very different phases during the March quarter. Based on Apple's performance during the first five weeks of the quarter, we were confident we were headed toward a record second quarter at the very high end of our expectations.\",\n",
       "    'In the next five weeks of the quarter, as COVID-19 started impacting China, iPhone supply was temporarily affected, as well as demand for our products within China. This caused us to withdraw our revenue guidance in February. At that point, demand for our products outside of China was still strong and in line with our expectations. During the last three weeks of the quarter, as the virus spread globally and social distancing measures were put in place worldwide, including the closure of all our retail stores outside of Greater China on March 13 and many channel partner points of sales around the world, we saw a downward pressure on demand particularly for iPhone and Wearables. Given the lack of visibility and certainty in the near term, we will not be issuing guidance for the coming quarter. Over the long term though, we have a high degree of confidence in the enduring strength of our business.',\n",
       "    'Our global supply chain is profoundly durable and resilient. We have shown the consistent ability to meet and manage temporary supply challenges like those caused by COVID-19. We have continued to deliver innovative new products across multiple categories that appeal to a broad cross section of customers, including the all-new iPhone SE, which achieved unmatched technological capacity at an incredible value. Our teams worldwide have tackled the complexities of this moment with unmatched creativity, good humor and dedication to our customers. For a company whose business is innovation, there are real upsides in periodically having to figure out how to do just about everything in a brand new way.',\n",
       "    \"Our long running investment in our Services strategy is succeeding. This business is growing and is a reflection of our enduring large and growing installed base. We expect to meet our long-standing goal of doubling our fiscal 2016 Services revenue in 2020. We have always run Apple for the long term. We entered this period with unmatched financial strength, a robust cash position and our best product pipeline ever. Major investments, including our five-year commitment to contribute $350 billion to the economy here in the United States are moving forward at full speed ahead. It's in these moments that we set ourselves apart. We've always managed through difficult moments by doubling down and investing in the next generation of innovation, and that's our strategy today.\",\n",
       "    \"And so while we can't say for sure how many chapters are in this book, we can have confidence that the ending will be a good one. Apple will continue to do everything we can do to help the global response and to keep our customers learning, creating, sharing and connecting so that live can remain as normal as it can during this challenging time.\",\n",
       "    \"With that, I'll hand things off to Luca.\",\n",
       "    'Thank you, Tim. Good afternoon, everyone.',\n",
       "    'It has been a very different quarter than we were expecting when we last talked to you at the end of January, but we could not be more proud of our Apple teams around the world, our role in supporting local communities and our partners throughout the value chain, and how resilient our business and financial performance has been during these challenging times.',\n",
       "    'So the revenue for the quarter was $58.3 billion, up 1% from a year ago, despite the extreme circumstances from the impact of COVID-19 and a headwind of 100 basis points from foreign exchange. Products revenue was $45 billion, down 3%. After a very strong January, our performance was impacted, particularly during the last three weeks of the quarter when lockdowns and point-of-sale closures increased due to COVID-19 spreading around the world and affected our product sales. However, on a demand basis, our performance was stronger than our reported results as we reduced iPhone channel inventory more than we did a year ago.',\n",
       "    'Importantly, our installed base of active devices reached an all-time high in all of our geographic segments and all major product categories.',\n",
       "    \"Services revenue followed a different trend with very strong year-over-year growth of 17%. We set a new all-time revenue record of $13.3 billion, with all-time records in many of our Services categories and in most countries we track. I'll provide more details on this later. Company gross margin was 38.4%, flat sequentially with cost savings and mix shift toward Services offset by the seasonal loss of leverage. Products gross margin was 30.3%, decreasing 380 basis points sequentially, due to loss of leverage and unfavorable mix. This drop was more pronounced than under normal circumstances due to the COVID-19 impact I mentioned earlier.\",\n",
       "    'Services gross margin was 65.4%, up 100 basis points sequentially, driven by favorable mix. Our reported tax rate for the quarter was 14.4%. This was lower than our 16.5% guidance due to onetime discrete items. Net income was $11.2 billion and earnings per share were $2.55, up 4%. Operating cash flow was very strong at $13.3 billion, an improvement of $2.2 billion over a year ago.',\n",
       "    \"Let me get into more detail for each of our revenue categories. iPhone revenue of $29 billion declined 7% year-over-year as both iPhone supply and demand were affected by the impact of COVID-19 at some point during the quarter. On the supply side, we suffered from some temporary supply shortages during February, but we've been extremely pleased with the resilience and adaptability of our global supply chain as well as its ability to get people back to work safely when circumstances allow. Our operations team and manufacturing partners put forth an extraordinary effort to restore production quickly, and we exited the quarter in a good supply position for most of our product lines.\",\n",
       "    'On the demand side, after a very strong first five weeks, we saw the impact of COVID-19 affect demand in China for the next five weeks and then more broadly around the world for the last three weeks of the quarter when lockdowns and point-of-sale closures became more widespread in many countries. While we did see a slight elongation in our replacement cycle toward the end of the quarter, which we attribute to the widespread point-of-sale closures, our active installed base of iPhones has reached an all-time high. This speaks to the quality of our products and strength of our ecosystem. In fact, in the US, the latest survey of consumers from 451 Research indicates iPhone customer satisfaction of 99% for iPhone 11, 11 Pro and 11 Pro Max combined.',\n",
       "    \"Turning to Services. We set an all-time revenue record of $13.3 billion. We had strong performance across the board with all-time revenue records in the App Store, Apple Music, video, cloud services and our App Store search ad business. And we also set a March quarter record for Apple Care. Our new services, Apple TV+, Apple Arcade, Apple News+ and Apple Card, continued to add users, content and features while contributing to overall Services growth. As Tim mentioned, we are well on our way to accomplishing our goal of doubling our fiscal '16 Services revenue during 2020.\",\n",
       "    'App Store revenue grew by strong double digits, thanks to robust customer demand for both in-app purchases and subscriptions. Our third-party subscription business grew across multiple categories and increased over 30% year-over-year, reaching a new all-time high. Our first-party subscription services also continued to perform very well. Apple Music and cloud services both set all-time revenue records, and Apple Care set a March quarter record. Paid subscriptions for all three of these services were up strong double digits. Customer engagement in our ecosystem continues to grow strongly, and the number of both transacting and paid accounts on our digital content stores reached a new all-time high during the March quarter. In particular, the number of paid accounts increased double digits in all of our geographic segments.',\n",
       "    'We now have over 515 million paid subscriptions across the services on our platform, up 125 million from a year ago. On a sequential basis, paid subscriptions grew by over 35 million. This is the highest sequential growth we have ever experienced. With this momentum, we are confident we will reach our increased target of 600 million paid subscriptions before the end of calendar 2020.',\n",
       "    \"Wearables, Home and Accessories established a new March quarter record, with revenue of $6.3 billion, up 23% year-over-year, with strong double-digit performance across all five geographic segments. Our Wearables business is now the size of a Fortune 140 company, and we're very excited by the many opportunities in front of us for this product category. For example, Apple Watch continues to extend its reach as over 75% of the customers purchasing Apple Watch around the world during the quarter, were new to the product.\",\n",
       "    \"Next, I'd like to talk about Mac and iPad. Mac revenue was $5.4 billion. iPad revenue was $4.4 billion. Towards the end of the quarter, we launched a brand-new iPad Pro that includes a first-in-class LiDAR scanner with some really exciting augmented reality applications, and MacBook Air, with significantly improved performance at a lower price. We're very pleased with the strong customer interest for both products. Importantly, around half of the customers purchasing Macs and iPads around the world during the quarter were new to that product. And the active installed base for both Mac and iPad reached a new all-time high. And the most recent surveys of consumers from 451 Research measured customer satisfaction at 95% for iPad and 96% for Mac.\",\n",
       "    \"In the enterprise market, businesses everywhere have been making the transition to working remotely. We've created content to assist our customers in this transition, including an on-demand video learning series focused on topics like remote deployments of iPads and Macs and security. We have also realigned our own retail business and enterprise teams to provide timely and relevant support to customers as they navigate new work environments. Some of our largest customers offering Mac to employees, such as IBM and SAP, have been able to pivot quickly to allow employees to easily set up and secure their devices from home, benefiting from Apple Business Manager and zero-touch deployment. And we've seen countless examples of new projects and remote deployments implemented in just a few hours. Peloton, for instance, worked with our New York teams to deploy an entire fleet of Macs overnight so their team could work remotely.\",\n",
       "    \"In essential sectors such as grocery and financial services, we're seeing organizations adopt our technology to better serve their customers safely. Leading grocers around the world like Trader Joe's, Woolworths, Lawsons, Sainsbury's, Lidl and Carrefour offer Apple Pay so customers can use contactless payments. And a store shift to become fulfillment centers for online orders, organizations are leveraging apps for remote shoppers and food delivery to reduce foot traffic. In banking, where safety and security is a top priority, one way to protect company and client information is by providing corporate iOS devices to employees who use mobile phones daily as part of the jobs. As an example, Bank of America is purchasing tens of thousands of additional iOS devices for their workforce.\",\n",
       "    'Let me now turn to our cash position. First, I want to note that our liquidity has not been an issue for us during these highly unusual financial market conditions. We have an extraordinarily strong balance sheet, very deep access to capital markets and unmatched free cash flow generation. We ended the quarter with $193 billion in cash plus marketable securities, total debt of $110 billion, and as a result, net cash was $83 billion at the end of the quarter. We returned $22 billion to shareholders during the March quarter, including $18.5 billion through open market repurchases of 64.7 million Apple shares and $3.4 billion in dividends and equivalents.',\n",
       "    \"Finally, as we move ahead into the June quarter, I'd like to provide some color on what we are seeing, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Tejas referred to at the beginning of the call. As Tim mentioned, given the lack of visibility and certainty in the near term, we will not be issuing guidance for the coming quarter. However, based on what we have seen in April and how we think things might play out, I would like to provide some additional insight on headwinds and tailwinds we're facing.\",\n",
       "    'From a foreign exchange standpoint, the US dollar has appreciated recently against most currencies around the world, and as a result, we expect our revenue to be negatively impacted by more than $1.5 billion on a year-over-year basis. Our global supply chain is back up and running. We are in a typical supply position, including our usual ramp associated with new products recently launched. These newly launched products, iPad Pro, MacBook Air and iPhone SE have all received outstanding customer response even during these extreme circumstances. On iPhone and Wearables, we expect the year-over-year revenue performance to worsen in the June quarter relative to the March quarter. On iPad and Mac, we expect the year-over-year revenue performance to improve in the June quarter.',\n",
       "    'On Services, we are seeing two distinct trends. First, customers are actively engaging with our ecosystem and digital services, and we believe the very strong recent performance in the App Store, video, Music and cloud services will continue throughout the June quarter. Second, due to the overall reduced level of economic activity due to the lockdowns around the world, services like Apple Care and advertising have been impacted. Apple Care is comprised of our product repair business and the warranty agreements with our customers, both of which have been obviously affected by store closures and reduced level of customer traffic. Advertising, which is comprised of third-party agreements, our App Store search ads and Apple News ads, has been impacted by overall economic weakness and uncertainty on when businesses will reopen.',\n",
       "    'For gross margin, sequential headwinds include foreign exchange, the mix within products and the seasonal loss of leverage on our product business. Foreign exchange will have 70 basis points impact sequentially and 130 basis points impact year-over-year. Regarding product mix, keep in mind the commentary we provided at the revenue level. Sequential tailwinds include cost savings and the mix shift toward Services. With regard to capital allocation, our approach remains unchanged. We continue to invest confidently in our future while also returning value to our shareholders.',\n",
       "    'We are in the midst of developing our most exciting pipeline of products and services ever while contributing over $350 billion to the US economy and expanding our footprint in many cities around the country over a five-year period. We also continue to believe that there is great value in our stock, and we are maintaining our target of reaching a net cash neutral position over time. As a testament to the confidence we have in our business today and into the future, our Board has authorized $50 billion for share repurchases in addition to the over $40 billion authorization remaining under the current share repurchase plan. Our Board has also authorized a 6% increase in our quarterly dividend and today declared a cash dividend of $0.82 per share of common stock payable on May 14, 2020, to shareholders of record as of May 11, 2020.',\n",
       "    \"Finally, and most importantly, we are managing Apple for the long term as we've always done. During uncertain times historically, we have continued to invest in the business, and this remains our philosophy. We will continue to stay focused on what we do best, investing in our product and service pipeline, managing the business wisely and taking care of our teams, and believe we will come out from this stronger.\",\n",
       "    \"With that, let's open the call to questions.\",\n",
       "    'Thank you, Luca.',\n",

       "    \"Thank you very much for taking my question. And I hope everyone is well. Tim, you talked about seeing some improvement in the second half of April. So I was wondering if you could just talk maybe a bit more on the segment and geographic basis, what you're seeing in the various regions that you're selling in and what you're hearing from your customers. And then I have a follow-up. Thank you.\",\n",
       "    \"And from a demand point of view, we saw an improvement in March over February. And if you look at kind of where we are today, we've seen further improvement in April as compared to March. And so that's China. If you look at the rest of the world, we were doing great in January, the first five weeks of the quarter. And we do believe that we were headed toward the sort of the top end of our expectations that we had talked to you about on the last call, that the next five weeks were spent reacting and getting the supply chain back up in full force, and working through the sharp decline in China that I already talked about.\",\n",
       "    \"In particular for, as I think Luca shared, we believe that iPad and Mac are going to improve on a year-over-year basis during this quarter. And that's customers that are either taking online education or working remotely. And so complex answer to your question, but that's what we're seeing.\",\n",
       "    \"Thank you. That was helpful. Luca, unless I missed it, you talked about various puts and takes in the quarter but didn't really discuss operating expenses. I know you mentioned some cost savings on the COGS line. I'm curious how you're thinking about your spending and opex, given some of the macro challenges that you may be facing. Thank you.\",\n",
       "    \"Yes, well, Shannon, as we said, we manage the company for the long term, right. So we know that the core of the business, the core of the company is innovation and product and services development, so we will continue to invest in our pipeline. We're very excited about what we have in store and so we will continue to invest there. Obviously, we are aware of the environment, and so we will manage the SG&A portion of the company tightly. We are making new investments in the new Services that we launched recently. As you know, we purchased the baseband activities from Intel. And obviously, we want to develop that technology because we consider it's a core technology for us.\",\n",
       "    'And so we will try to balance the need to continue to invest during difficult circumstances and the fact that we like to manage the business wisely.',\n",
       "    'Thank you, Shannon. Can we have the next question, please?',\n",
       "    'That will be from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America.',\n",
       "    \"Yes, thank you. Tim, I think I speak for everyone on the call that we're all very appreciative of Apple's contribution during this pandemic. We all appreciate it.\",\n",
       "    'Thank you very much for that.',\n",
       "    \"No, it's been great. Tim, in past downturns, we have not really seen Apple pull back from investing, and you as a company have largely maintained the product introduction cadence. But given these are unprecedented times and there are a lot of challenges associated with product development during a time when you have a global footprint for such activities and unable to really do a lot of things in person, how should we think about the product development and introduction cadence as we go over the next several quarters? And I have a follow-up.\",\n",
       "    \"Well, we're continuing to operate. And so as you can tell, along with everything else going on, we were able to launch and ship the iPhone SE, the iPad Pro with the Magic Keyboard and the MacBook Air. And so business continues and the new products are our lifeblood. And so we're continuing to work. Everybody is getting used to the work at home. In some areas of the company, people may be even more productive. In some other areas, they're not as productive, and so it's mixed depending upon what the roles are.\",\n",
       "    \"But as you can tell from what we did this quarter, despite the environment, we have our head down, are working because we know that our customers want the products that we've got. They are even more important in these times.\",\n",
       "    \"Thank you, Tim. As a follow-up, I know you're doing a lot with both the Apple Card and financing plan for iPhones to get your products in the hands of customers. But I was wondering, would you consider using the strength of your balance sheet maybe a little differently structured, maybe deferred payments or things like that? Or do you think that there could be other steps like bundling that you will consider versus what you already currently do? Thank you.\",\n",
       "    \"Well, as you know, we launched the payment plan earlier on Apple Card for iPhone. We're working on doing that for other products as well, and you'll see something on that shortly. So we're very focused on the affordability point. The trade-in programs also are fairly wide across the board and act as both something great for the environment, also something great from a way to get that entry price down. In terms of deferred payments, nothing to announce today. But as you know, having access to the Card, at least in the United States, gives us more degrees of freedom, and that is not using our balance sheet. But we play a key role in deciding what kind of programs go with the Card.\",\n",
       "    'Thanks, Wamsi. Can we have the next question, please?',\n",
       "    \"That will come from Morgan Stanley's Katy Huberty.\",\n",
       "    \"Thank you for the question. I hope the whole team is staying healthy and safe. Tim, I want to start on a longer-term question. Where do you see structural changes on the back of this health crisis that might present opportunities for new revenue streams at Apple? And I'm particularly thinking about your past comments on health and augmented reality, but I'm sure there's even more areas of inspiration and creativity coming out of the company. And then I have a follow-up.\",\n",
       "    \"On the health area, I gave some examples in my opening comments about the ECG being used on the Watch. You can bet that we're looking at other areas in this. We were already doing that because we've viewed that that area was a huge opportunity for the company and a way for us to help a lot of people. And so you will see us continue on that. I wouldn't say that the health door opened wider. I would say it was already opened fairly wide.\",\n",
       "    'Okay. And then as a follow-up, the $50 billion share repurchase authorization is impressive in absolute terms, but it is a bit lower than the last couple of years. So just any context around the thought process of landing on $50 billion? And then related to that, you have one of the strongest balance sheets in the world. Does the current environment change your thinking at all around M&A opportunities?',\n",
       "    \"Well, let me answer that, Katy. First of all, on the buyback, as I said, in general, our approach to capital allocation has remained the same for the last several years, and it's not changing now. Keep in mind, here we're talking about just the authorization, right. And when you look at our actual results at the end of every quarter, you see how much we actually do in terms of share repurchases. The $50 billion is in addition to over $40 billion that is still remaining from the past authorization that we've received from our Board, right. So it's the total available or outstanding in terms of authorization is over $90 billion.\",\n",
       "    \"And as you look at our run rate during the last several years, you know that that is a very adequate amount. And as you know, we will provide an additional update a year from now. So nothing really has changed there. And nothing has changed on our approach for M&A. We've been quite active over the last several years. We purchase companies on a very regular basis. We're always looking for ways to accelerate our product road maps or fill gaps in our portfolio, both on the hardware side, on the software side, on the Services side. So we will continue to do that. And so also on the M&A front, nothing has changed.\",\n",
       "    'Thank you. Be well.',\n",
       "    'Thank you.',\n",
       "    'Thanks, Katy. Can we have the next question, please?',\n",
       "    'That will come from Amit Daryanani with Evercore.',\n",
       "    'Thanks for taking my question. I have two as well. I guess, first off, on the channel inventory, I was hoping if you could talk about how did channel inventory looked like in the March quarter, because it sounds like it may be below the historical ranges. And then the discussion you had for June quarter performance of iPhones, what are you embedding from a channel building back inventory levels in that expectation?',\n",
       "    \"That's really helpful. And could I just follow up? Tim, I was hoping you could maybe talk a little bit about how do you think about Apple's manufacturing strategy and perhaps need for some diversity, especially given everything the company and everyone has gone through over the last 12 months. How do you think about that? And do you feel comfortable that the supply chain and the manufacturing base is well situated today to launch the traditional fall products that they used to get from Apple?\",\n",
       "    'Thank you, Amit. Can we have the next question, please?',\n",
       "    \"We'll hear from Jeriel Ong with Deutsche Bank.\",\n",
       "    \"Hi guys, thanks for letting me ask couple of questions. So I want to focus the question on Services. The segment was solid in the quarter in spite overall macro weakness. I can kind of see the logic behind it being strong despite product weakness overall. As you kind of look at the rest of the year, do you think that's sustained? Or at some point, does the macro impacts worldwide impact the Services line?\",\n",
       "    \"Jeriel, let me take that one. We typically don't give a lot of specifics about our categories. But I've said, as we look into the June quarter, we see two distinct trends in our Services business overall. Our ecosystem is very strong. Our customers are very engaged. We are continuing to grow double digits the number of transacting accounts and paid accounts. And so we expect our digital services to continue at the same level of performance that we have seen during the March quarter. And that includes the App Store, of course, our video business, our Music business, cloud services, so we expect all these businesses to continue to grow very strongly.\",\n",
       "    \"Given the overall economic environment, the level of demand right now, there are two businesses that we believe are going to be impacted during the June quarter. One of them is Apple Care. Apple Care is essentially comprised of our product repair business and the warranty agreements that we signed with our customers when they purchased our devices. Both these businesses have been affected obviously by the store closures, not only our retail stores but also our partners' points of sale. And obviously, the reduced level of customer traffic because of the social distancing measures, right. And we do expect Apple Care to be affected during the June quarter.\",\n",
       "    'The other business which we think is going to be impacted by the overall economic weakness and the uncertainty on when businesses will reopen is advertising, which is the sum of our advertising business on the App Store, on Apple News and the third-party agreements that we have on the advertising front. So these are two things that, during the June quarter, will create a headwind for the Services business.',\n",
       "    \"Got it. Appreciate that. My second question comes about the overall purchasing decisions consumers are making. So far through April, have you seen increased perhaps downticks across your product line? So for example, somebody might have a shift maybe toward the lower end of the storage mix of certain products. And do you expect that going forward as unemployment uptick and macro impacts kind of layer on through rest of '20? Thanks.\",\n",
       "    'Thanks, Jeriel. Can we have the next question, please?',\n",
       "    'All right. Thanks, guys.',\n",
       "    \"That will be from JP Morgan's Samik Chatterjee.\",\n",
       "    \"Hi, thanks for taking the question. So if I can just start with a question on kind of what you're seeing in China, you mentioned kind of the pickup in activity. But is that driven by more kind of footfall in the stores or what you're seeing relative to online activity and how much of this recovery is driven online? Any thoughts on that, please?\",\n",
       "    \"So there is definitely a move. And whether that's a permanent shift, I would hesitate to go that far as I think people like to be out and about. They just know that now is not the time to do that.\",\n",
       "    \"Got it. And if I can just follow up on your previous comment about the strong demand you're seeing for iPhone SE, just given the price point, I'm wondering if you're expecting any change in terms of the geographic mix of where the demand comes from relative to typically what you see for other iPhones in the lineup just given the lower price point.\",\n",
       "    'Thank you. Can we have the next question, please?',\n",
       "    'Certainly. Our last question today will be from Chris Caso with Raymond James.',\n",
       "    'Yes, thank you. I wanted to follow up with another question on iPhone SE and the decision to bring it back and where it sits within the total iPhone strategy. And I guess coupled with the fact that iPhone 11, you made the decision to bring that at a lower price point, what does that tell us with respect to your approach to iPhone pricing and flexibility? Is this helping to add users and kind of bring people into the ecosystem? And if so, what does that imply for gross margins?',\n",
       "    \"Chris, we've always been about delivering the best product at a good price, and that fundamental strategy has not changed at all. As you know, we did have an SE for a while. It's great to bring it back. It was a beloved product. And so I wouldn't read anything into that other than we want to give people the best deal that we can while making the best product.\",\n",
       "    'Okay. As a follow-up, the follow-up question is on commodity pricing, and I think you had expected to see some commodity price declines through the March quarter. If you could talk about what you expect as you go through the year perhaps in this new environment, and again, whether that turned into a tailwind or a headwind for gross margins as you go into the second half.',\n",
       "    'Yeah. For March, Chris, we saw NAND pricing increase slightly, while DRAM and displays and other commodities declined. For the June quarter, we would expect NAND and DRAM pricing to remain at this historically low level, while displays and most other commodity prices, we expect to decline.',\n",

We're thrilled to report Apple's biggest quarter ever, which set new all-time records in both revenue and earnings. We generated revenue of $91.8 billion, which is above the high end of our guidance range, with revenue growth accelerating for the third consecutive quarter. Geographically, we set all-time records in the Americas, Europe and Rest of Asia Pacific, and solid Greater China returned to growth. Our record performance was fueled by iPhone where December quarter revenue was up 8% year-over-year and by our fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth outside of iPhone, including a new all-time record for Services and another blowout quarter for Wearables.\",\n",
       "    \"Our active installed base of devices has now surpassed 1.5 billion, up over 100 million in the last 12 months alone reaching a new all-time high for each of our main product categories and geographic segments. Not only is our large and growing installed base of powerful testament to the satisfaction engagement and loyalty of our customers, but it's also fueling our growth across the board, particularly in Services.\",\n",
       "    \"Let's take each category one by one. On iPhone, revenue in the December quarter was $56 billion. Again, that's up 8% over year ago. Thanks to the exceptional demand for the iPhone 11, iPhone 11 Pro and iPhone 11 Pro Max. In fact, iPhone 11 was our top selling model every week during the December quarter, and the three new models were our three most popular iPhones. We had double-digit growth in many developed markets, including the US, the UK, France and Singapore and also grew double-digits in emerging markets, led by strong performances in Brazil, Mainland China, India, Thailand and Turkey. These new models are by far the best iPhone's we've ever shipped with advanced technologies and unprecedented leap in battery life to easily get through the day and our best-in-class camera experience. We have been wild with the photos customers have shared in our all-new Night Mode photo challenge this month.\",\n",
       "    \"Turning to Services. Q1 revenue reached $12.7 billion, an all-time record growing 17% over last year. Once again, we saw double-digit growth in all five of our geographic segments and established new all-time records for multiple categories, including cloud services, music, payment services and our App Store search ad business, as well as setting a December quarter record for the App Store and Apple Care. 2019 was a historic year for our Services business. And I'd like to draw some highlights. For the App Store, 2020 started off strong with customers spending a new single day record $386 million on New Year's Day alone, a 20% increase over last year. Apple Arcade, our new game subscription service, has been fast off the blocks with a catalog of over 100 new and exclusive games you won't find anywhere else, all playable across Apple devices with new games and expansions added every month.\",\n",

We are thrilled with the continued growth of Apple Card.

Apple Watch had a great start to fiscal 2020, setting an all-time revenue record during the quarter. It continues to have a profound impact on our customers' lives and it continues to further its reach as over 75% of the customers purchasing Apple Watch during the quarter were new to Apple Watch.

       "    'Thank you, Tim. Good afternoon, everyone. Our business and financial performance in the December quarter were exceptional as we set new all-time records for revenue, net income and earnings per share. Revenue for the quarter was $91.8 billion, up $7.5 billion or 9% from a year ago in spite of a $1 billion headwind from foreign exchange. Geographically, we established all-time revenue records in many major developed and emerging markets, including among others, the US, Canada, Mexico, Brazil, the UK, Germany, France, Italy, Spain, Poland, Thailand, Malaysia and Vietnam. Products revenue was $79.1 billion, up 8% as iPhone return to growth, and we have incredibly strong results in Wearables where we set all-time records for both Apple Watch and AirPods. Services revenue grew 17% to a new all-time record $12.7 billion, with double-digit growth in every geographic segment, a new all-time record across our portfolio.',\n",
       "    'Company gross margin was 38.4%, up 40 basis points sequentially, driven by leverage from higher revenue in spite of a negative 60 basis point impact from foreign exchange. Products gross margin was 34.2% up 260 basis points sequentially. Thanks to leverage and favorable mix. Services gross margin was 64.4%, up 30 basis points sequentially, driven by favorable mix.',\n",
       "    'Our reported tax rate for the quarter was 14.2%. Before discrete items, the rate was 16.5%, exactly in line with our guidance. A favorable one-time item impacted the rate by 230 basis points. Net income was an all-time record at $22.2 billion, up $2.3 billion or 11% over last year. Diluted EPS was also an all-time record at $4.99, up 19%, and operating cash flow was a very strong $30.5 billion, an improvement of $3.8 billion over a year ago.',\n",
       "    'Let me get into more detail for each of our revenue categories. iPhone revenue of $56 billion grew 8% year-over-year as we saw a great customer response to the launch of our newest iPhones. We set all-time revenue records in several countries, including the US, Mexico, the UK, France, Spain, Poland, Thailand, Malaysia and Vietnam. Our active installed base of iPhones has reached an all-time high and is growing in each of our geographic segments. In the US, the latest survey of consumers from 451 Research indicates iPhone customer satisfaction of 98% for iPhone 11, 11 Pro and 11 Pro Max combined. Among business buyers planning to purchase smartphones in the next quarter, 84% plan to purchase iPhones.',\n",
       "    \"Turning to services. We set an all-time revenue record of $12.7 billion with double-digit growth in all of our five geographic segments. As Tim mentioned, we established new all-time records for Apple Music, cloud services, payment services and our App Store search ad business and December quarter records for the App Store and Apple Care. We are well on our way to accomplishing our goal of doubling our fiscal year '16 Services revenue during 2020. We've actually already reached that goal on a run rate basis with the results of the December quarter.\",\n",

We now have over 480 million paid subscriptions across the services on our platform, up 120 million from a year ago. And at this point, we expect to hit our goal of surpassing the 500 million mark already during the March quarter. Given the tremendous momentum we are experiencing across our services offerings, we are increasing our target for paid subscriptions and aim to reach 600 million before the end of calendar 2020.',\n",
       "    \"App Store revenue grew strong double-digits. Thanks to robust customer demand for both in-app purchases and subscriptions. Our third-party subscription business grew across multiple categories and increased almost 40% year-over-year. Our first-party subscription services also continue to perform extremely well. Apple Music set an all-time revenue record offering a catalog of over 60 million songs to our customers. iCloud also generated an all-time revenue record growing very strong double-digits, while offering our customers a safe, secure and seamless experience across all their devices. It was a December quarter record for Apple Care. Thanks to strong service agreement attach rates and expanded distribution. Many of our partners have come to appreciate the strength of the Apple Care brand and our ability to deliver the very best service and support in the world. That value resonates with both our partners and our customers, and we're very happy to see that quality of experience delivered to more and more of our users.\",\n",
       "    'Wearables, Home and Accessories established a new all-time record with revenue of $10 billion, up 37% year-over-year with very strong double-digit performance across all five geographic segments and growth across wearables, accessories and home. We set all-time records for wearables in virtually every market we track, even as we experienced some product shortages due to very strong customer demand for both Apple Watch and AirPod during the quarter.',\n",
       "    \"We also continue to see strong demand for our products in the enterprise market as our technology solutions enable businesses to do their best work. 100% of Fortune 500 companies in the healthcare sector use Apple technology in areas such as patient experience, clinical communications and nursing workflows, and we're also seeing smaller companies in this sector drive innovation with our technology and apps. One example is Gauss Surgical, which uses CoreML in iOS to more accurately estimate blood loss during childbirth and surgery. This helps clinicians have more complete and timely information on whether a patient needs an intervention, which can impact both clinical outcomes and cost. Another example is Butterfly Network, a medical imaging company which makes a handheld ultrasound device that connects to iPhone or iPad to enable clinicians to take ultrasound anywhere at a cost that is dramatically lower than other solutions in the market today.\",\n",
       "    'Let me now turn to our cash positions. We ended the quarter with $207 billion in cash plus marketable securities.

As a result, net cash was $99 billion at the end of the quarter, and we maintain our target of reaching a net cash neutral position over time. We returned nearly $25 billion to shareholders during the December quarter. We began a $10 billion accelerated share repurchase program in November, resulting in the initial delivery and retirement of 30.4 million shares. We also repurchased 40 million Apple shares for $10 billion through open market transactions. And we paid $3.5 billion in dividends and equivalents. As we have done for the last several years, we would share our plans for the next phase of our capital return program when we report results for the March quarter.',\n",
       "    \"Finally, as we move ahead into the March quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Tejas referred to at the beginning of the call. We expect revenue to be between $63 billion and $67 billion. The wider-than-usual revenue range comprehends uncertainty related to the recently unfolding public health situation in China. We expect gross margin to be between 38% and 39%. We expect opex to be between $9.6 billion and $9.7 billion. We expect OI&E to be about $250 million. And we expect the tax rate to be about 16.5%. Also today, our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.77 per share of common stock payable on February 13, 2020 to shareholders of record as of February 10, 2020.\",\n",
       "    \"With that, let's open the call to questions.\",\n",
       "    'Thank you, Luca. We ask that you limit yourself to two questions. Operator, may we have the first question please?',\n",
       "    'Questions and Answers:',\n",
       "    'Yes. That will be from Amit Daryanani with Evercore.',\n",
       "    \"Thanks a lot. Good afternoon, guys. I guess first one for me on Wearables, fairly impressive to see it's already a $10 billion business for you guys. Can you just touch on the growth that you see on the Wearables side? How much of the growth you think is coming from first-time buyers of AirPods or Apple Watch versus folks that seem to be just upgrading the products that they have because it looks to us adoption rates are fairly low in your installed base, so that there should be a long runway, but love to just understand how you see the growth divide up between those two buckets?\",\n",
       "    \"Perfect. And I guess, Luca, if you could just touch on gross margins, the March quarter guide I think implied gross margins of flat to actually up 10 basis points, 15 basis points. It's rare for you guys to actually guide gross margins up in March, I think, because you have a fairly high seasonal sales deleverage happening. So what are the offsets that's enabling, what looks like a better-than-seasonal guide for gross margins?\",\n",
       "    \"Yes, that's right, Amit. It's about flat sequentially. And by the way, significantly higher on a year-over-year basis, but on a sequential basis, you're right on one side, we've got the loss of leverage from the usual seasonality. But we expect that, that loss of leverage will be offset by better mix and cost savings.\",\n",
       "    'Thank you, Amit. Can we have the next question please?',\n",
       "    'That will come from Tom Forte with DA Davidson.',\n",
       "    \"Great, thank you for taking my question. So congrats on the launch of Apple TV+. I wanted to know internally how you're engaging success? Is it purely on critical acclaim? Is it on a number of consumers that are using the service, contribution of service revenue, etc., etc.? Thank you.\",\n",
       "    \"Great. And then my second question is, I think you indicated that last month, you started offering consumers the ability to use a Apple Card to buy an iPhone on an installment basis. Can you talk about how that's had an impact on your unit sales for iPhones?\",\n",
       "    \"So retail stores did fantastic on iPhone, very strong double-digit growth in iPhone from a year-over-year point of view. And one of the factors that enabled that was the getting to a monthly payment on the Apple Card to make it very simple. Of course, that's US-only at this point, but the US is a very key market for us. And so, it was an important part of it.\",\n",
       "    'Thank you, Tom. Can we have the next question please?',\n",
       "    'That will come from Shannon Cross, Cross Research.',\n",
       "    \"Yeah. Thanks, Shannon. In terms of China, the results from last quarter and then I'll get into the coronavirus second. For the results from last quarter, we had double-digit growth for iPhone in Mainland China. So that was an important change from where we had been running. We also had double-digit growth in services in Mainland China, and we had extremely strong double-digit on wearables. And so, really there were a number of different factors. In terms of the things that customers are responding to, iPhone 11 is doing particularly well there. The product has been very well received with its battery life and the camera is unbelievable. We also, as you probably know, have certain trade-in programs going and financing programs. These have also been well received.\",\n",
       "    \"In terms of the coronavirus. As I had mentioned earlier, first and foremost, our thoughts with all of those that are affected across the region and as I had mentioned, we're donating to groups that are working to contain the outbreak. We're also working very closely with our team and our partners in the affected areas, and we have limited travel to business-critical situations as of last week. The situation is emerging, and we're still gathering lots of data points and monitoring it very closely. As Luca had mentioned, we have a wider-than-usual revenue range for the second quarter due to the greater uncertainty.\",\n",
       "    \"With respect to customer demand and sales, we've currently closed one of our retail stores and a number of channel partners have also closed their storefronts. Many of the stores that remain open have also reduced operating hours. We're taking additional precautions and frequently deep cleaning our stores as well as conducting temperature checks for employees. While our sales within the Wuhan area itself are small, retail traffic has also been impacted outside of this area across the country in the last few days. And again, we have attempted to account for this in our guidance range that we've provided you. I hope that gets you some color.\",\n",
       "    \"Yeah, that was very helpful. Luca, maybe if you could just touch on, from a gross margin perspective, the commodity pricing environment and availability, obviously there's been some movement on DRAM and NAND. So if you can talk about how you're thinking about inventory levels and managing that going forward. Thank you.\",\n",
       "    \"Yes, as I said earlier to the question around the gross margin guidance for the March quarter, we are seeing a benign commodity environment. Most commodities have been declining during the December quarter, and we expect the same to happen in the March quarter. As always and as you probably know, we look at the way these prices move and at times when we feel it's appropriate, we buy certain commodities in advance. And so, we will continue that practice as we go through the year.\",\n",
       "    'Thank you, Shannon. Can we have the next question please?',\n",
       "    'That will come from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley.',\n",
       "    'Thank you. Good afternoon. Luca, can you address the modest slowdown in services growth this quarter, 17% versus 18% in September? Which services categories accelerated versus where did you see some deceleration in the growth?',\n",
       "    \"Katy, let me make a couple of comments here. 17% during the December quarter, we look at it against our fiscal year '19 growth rate, which was 16%. So we feel very good about the results for the December quarter. As Tim and I mentioned during our prepared remarks, it was a very broad-based growth because we grew double-digits in services across all the five geographies. We set all-time records for many, many categories, music, cloud, search ads, payment services, December records for the App Store and Apple Care.\",\n",
       "    \"If you remember, we had set two goals for ourselves in the Services segment. First, we set a goal to double our fiscal '16 revenue during 2020, and when we look at it on a run rate basis, we've already achieved that goal with the results for the December quarter. We also set a goal to pass 500 million paid subscriptions during 2020 and given that we are already at 480 million at the end of December, we expect to pass that mark during the March quarter. And so, now we are setting a new target for ourselves for paid subscriptions. And so, we are now aiming to reach 600 million before the end of calendar 2020. So we feel that the services business is growing incredibly well. Of course, we have launched new services very recently; for example, Apple TV+ just launched in November. And so while these services did not have a material impact in our December quarter results, we expect that over time these are contributing to the growth of the Services business, but we feel very happy with the 17%.\",\n",
       "    \"Thank you for that. Tim, as a follow-up, at some point in the future, Apple will launch a 5G iPhone, how big of a demand driver do you view 5G capability in a handset? And what's your view as to what the killer app will be from a consumer perspective?\",\n",
       "    'Thanks, Katy. Can we have the next question please?',\n",
       "    \"We'll hear from Kyle McNealy with Jefferies.\",\n",
       "    \"Hi, thanks a lot. So we're seeing some signs of new spectrum being deployed for 5G deployments and even additional 4G capacity, and it's already having a positive impact for handset upgrades to use that new capacity. Do you get the sense that wireless carriers are getting more incentivized to upgrade handsets to get leverage out of these new network investments? How much might this be helping and do you think it will continue to accelerate?\",\n",
       "    \"I think that we've had some great partners, not only in the US, but also around the world that was really helpful this quarter as partners. And so, I think probably a part of that is the level of investments they have and then a part of it is probably making sure that those customers stick with them in an environment where there's a lot of trading back and forth. So I'm optimistic that it will continue.\",\n",
       "    'Okay, great. And then the comment that you made about capacity in your Wearables division with AirPods Pro and Apple Watch 3, what should we think about the timeline of when there is capacity constraints might be alleviated and will they come from capacity additions or the natural work out of kind of unit shipments and something on the demand side?',\n",
       "    \"I'm hopeful that the Series 3 will come into balance during this quarter on AirPods Pro. I don't have an estimate for that for you. I just can't predict when at this point. We seem to be fairly substantially off there, and we're working very hard to put in additional capacity.\",\n",
       "    'Thanks, Kyle. Can we have the next question please?',\n",
       "    'Yes, Wamsi Mohan, Bank of America.',\n",
       "    'Yes. Thank you. Tim, Apple has a very valuable installed base of users. Can you see a future where Apple can become larger in the advertising market as you build out TV+ given you could have the unique position and ability to drive targeted ads to users without compromising on privacy?',\n",
       "    'Okay, thank you. And Luca, can you just clarify if the Services revenue this quarter had any impact of deferrals associated with TV+ at all and how can you help us maybe size the impact of the amortization of the content cost associated with TV+ as we think about the next couple of years? Thank you.',\n",
       "    \"Yeah. So yes, of course, we launched the service. And so, there was a very small contribution to revenue from the deferral, and there was also contribution to revenue from the people, the subscribers that are actually paying for the service. When you think about what goes into the Apple TV+ revenue at this point, there are two components, the paid subscribers. These are customers that pay for the service. And we recognize revenue over the subscription period. And then, we've got the, what we call, the Apple TV+ bundle subscribers. These are the customers that buy an eligible hardware device and redeem the offer for a three-year of TV+ services. We defer revenue for this offer based on three items. The first one is the value of the service that is being provided, the one year of Apple TV+. The second one is the number of customers that are eligible for the offer. And the third one is our estimate of the expected number of customers that we redeem the offer.\",\n",
       "    'So you need to keep in mind that from our total eligible device sales, you need to make a number of reductions for family sharing, for multiple device purchases and for geographic availability. Also the take rates can also be impacted by the availability of local content, and we also require a payment method on file. So this estimate is reviewed quarterly and gets updated based on actual trends of the offer. And so, these inputs provide us with the amount of revenue that we defer for each device sale that then gets recognized over the one year period that the TV+ service is provided. And so, when you take the combination of paid subscribers and bundled subscribers, you get the Apple TV+ revenue, of course because we launched the service very recently. The amount of revenue that we recognized during the quarter was immaterial to our results.',\n",
       "    'Thanks, Wamsi. Can we have the next question please?',\n",
       "    \"We'll hear from Cowen and Company's Krish Sankar.\",\n",
       "    \"Yeah. Hi, thanks for taking my question, and congrats on the great results. I have two questions. First one, Tim, I just wanted to pick your brain a little bit on the overall smartphone market. There is a general view that when 5G phones come out, they're going to be more expensive due to higher component costs. But at the same time, it looks like you guys have proven that there is a market for low- cost geographies with phones like iPhone SE. So how do you see these two different segments within the smartphone market evolving over the next one to three years? And then I had a follow-up for Luca.\",\n",
       "    \"Again, I want to stay away from commenting about future products. But generally, I think it's important when you think about 5G is to look around the world at the different deployment schedules. And some of those look very different perhaps than what you might be seeing here. And so, that's very important. In terms of the price, I wouldn't want to comment on the price of handsets that aren't announced.\",\n",
       "    'Got it. No worries, Tim. And then I have a follow-up to Luca. Opex as a percentage of sales for March looks like about 15% higher than in your prior quarters. Kind of curious how much of that is part of it is driven by some of your Intel modem asset purchases or TV+ in the opex or how do we think about it on a go-forward basis?',\n",
       "    'Thanks, Krish. Can we have the next question please?',\n",
       "    'That will be from Mike Olson with Piper Sandler.',\n",
       "    \"Okay. And then I think you recently mentioned that augmented reality will pervade our entire lives. And I'm wondering if you could share your thoughts about how you think it starts to impact our lives more significantly? For example, will the inflection point in AR come from gaming or industrial usage or some other category. In other words, where will the average person, kind of, first feel the impact of AR on their lives in a significant way? Thanks.\",\n",
       "    'Thank you, Mike. Can we have the next question please?',\n",
       "    'That will come from Raymond James, Chris Caso.',\n",
       "    \"Yes. Thank you. Good afternoon. I guess the first question is on gross margins and you spoke about the favorable mix. Wondering if you could expand on that a little bit and clearly, iPhone is doing well within the overall mix that growing year-on-year. But if you could talk about what's happening to the mix within iPhone, is that improving as well and also helping margins and is there anything else you would point to with regard to the overall mix in margins?\",\n",
       "    \"Yes, I think that the mix helped us both in Q1 and it's helping us with the guidance for Q2. And as you said, some of it is mix of iPhones. The customer response for iPhone 11, 11 Pro and 11 Pro Max has been exceptional and that clearly has helped our mix. iPhone 11 was our top-selling model throughout the quarter, every single week of the quarter. And so, certainly better mix within iPhone. The other point that I would like to point out is that as we move from Q1 to Q2, the proportion of revenue coming from Services increases versus the holiday quarter. And given the fact that Services are accretive to gross margin for the Company, we end up getting a better mix from Services as well.\",\n",
       "    'Okay, thank you. And I guess, follow-on question with regard to opex and it has been growing at a faster rate than revenue for, I guess, largely over the last three years or so, can you set us some expectation with regard to when you get a return on that investment? I understand there are new investments that are happening now. But how should we think about potential leverage going forward? Is there a point in time where the opex spending tends to level off and you get some return on that or is it just a function of faster revenue growth in the future?',\n",
       "    \"Well, I would start by saying that our expense-to-revenue ratio is incredibly competitive relative to other companies in our sector. There are years when our opex grows faster than our revenue. But we've also had years in the recent past, where the opposite has happened. We continue to believe that we have a lot of great opportunities in front of us. And just if you look at this past year, we launched many new initiatives for example on the Services front, which we want to support with the appropriate level of investment, not only marketing and advertising, but also in R&D. As I mentioned earlier, we closed the acquisition of the Intel baseband business because we think it's a very important strategic core technology for the Company going forward.\",\n",
       "    'Thank you. Can we have the next question please?',\n",
       "    'That will come from Samik Chatterjee with JP Morgan.',\n",
       "    \"Hi, thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to kind of ask on the iPhone revenue growth. Definitely good to see a return to growth based on the velocity or momentum you're seeing for the products exiting the quarter, how comfortable are you feeling about sustaining growth in iPhone revenues through the year? And I have a follow-up.\",\n",
       "    \"We have a practice of forecasting the current quarter. And so, we've given you the range that we expect that the current quarter and really don't give a range beyond that.\",\n",
       "    \"Yeah. So, Japan was down 10% during the December quarter. It was primarily due to iPhone performance, which was challenge because there were some regulatory changes that took effect on October 1 where essentially the regulators decoupled the mobile phone pricing from the two-year contracts and are capping the maximum amount of carrier discounts that can be made. At the same time, I would say within a more difficult macro environment, iPhone did incredibly well during the quarter. Six of the Top 7 selling smartphone models in Japan during the December quarter were iPhones. So it was a very strong performance by iPhone in a difficult environment. Also in June, we had a very strong double-digit growth from Services, stronger than Company average and very strong double-digit growth in Wearables, also stronger than Company average. So we feel very good. Japan is a country where historically we've had great success. The customers are very loyal and very engaged, and we have very strong position there. And we feel we have a very good momentum.\",\n",

       "    'Revenue for the quarter was $64 billion, up 2% from a year ago to a new September quarter record as we had predicted foreign exchange negatively impacted our revenue by close to $1 billion, and in constant currency, our growth was 3%. Products revenue was $51.5 billion, down 1% from last year, mainly due to iPhone, but largely offset by very strong performance from Wearables and iPad. Services revenue grew 18% to $12.5 billion, up over $1.9 billion year-over-year and almost $1.1 billion sequentially to a new all-time record with broad-based growth around the world and across our portfolio.',\n",
       "    'On a geographic basis, we set new fourth quarter revenue records in our Americas and Rest of Asia Pacific segments.

       "    'At a country level, we established new Q4 records in many major developed and emerging markets including the U.S., Canada, Germany, France, Korea, Singapore, Brazil, India, Thailand, Malaysia and Vietnam.',\n",
       "    'Company gross margin was 38%, up 40 basis points sequentially, driven by leverage from higher revenue. Products gross margin was 31.6%, up 120 basis points sequentially due to leverage and favorable mix. Services gross margin was 64.1% even with the June quarter.',\n",
       "    'Net income was $13.7 billion. Diluted EPS was a Q4 record at $3.03 and up 4% year-over-year, and operating cash flow of $19.9 billion was also a Q4 record, up almost $400 million from the previous record we set last year.',\n",
       "    'Let me get into more detail for each of our revenue categories. iPhone revenue was $33.4 billion a year-over-year decline of 9%. This was a meaningful improvement to the 12% decline in the third quarter and a 16% decline in the first half of the fiscal year. And we saw great customer response to the launch of iPhone 11, 11 Pro and 11 Pro max at the end of the quarter. Our active installed base of iPhone continue to grow to a new all-time high in each of our geographic segments. And in the U.S., the latest survey of consumers from 451 Research indicates iPhone customer satisfaction of 99% for iPhone XR, XS and XS Max combined. Among business buyers who plan to purchase smartphones in the December quarter 83% plan to purchase iPhones.',\n",
       "    'Turning to Services, we had a very strong quarter with all-time record performance and growth accelerating from the June quarter. All five geographic segments set new all-time Services revenue records and all grew double-digits. We also established new all-time records for the App Store, Apple Care, Music, Cloud Services, Payment Services and our App Store search ad business. In total, services accounted for 20% of our revenue mix and 33% of our gross margin mix.',\n",

       "    \"Next I would like to talk about the Mac. Revenue was $7 billion, down 5% from last year due to a different mix of products, given the strength of our MacBook Air lineup and a difficult comparison to last year's launch of MacBook Pro models. Despite the tough compare, we generated an all-time revenue record for Mac in the U.S. and in India and a fourth quarter revenue record in Japan. More than half of the customers purchasing Macs during the quarter were new to Mac, and the active installed base of Macs again reached a new all-time high.\",\n",
       "    'We had great results for iPad with revenue of $4.7 billion, up 17% from a year ago. iPad revenue grew in all five of our geographic segments with a Q4 revenue record in Japan. In total, over half of the customers purchasing iPads during the September quarter were new to iPad, and the iPad active installed base also reached a new all-time high. The most recent surveys from 451 Research measured a 95% customer satisfaction rating for iPad from consumers and 97% from businesses.

And as Tim mentioned, we set Q4 records for our Wearables category in every single market we track around the world.',\n",
       "    'Our retail and online stores produced fantastic results, generating record September quarter revenue in all five geographic segments, and strong double-digit growth across iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch and accessories.

       "    'We are seeing strong demand for our products in the enterprise market, with growth significantly ahead of our business overall, and we have great momentum transforming major industries. One example is retail. 80 of the 100 largest retailers in the world are choosing Apple to modernize their customers and employee experiences across all functions of their business.',\n",
       "    \"Retailers are using iPhone, iPad and Mac to optimize their back of house operations, modernize point of sale, and deliver differentiated customer and employee experiences.

Hundreds of thousands of Apple devices will be deployed this fiscal year to support an innovative new model for the collection and management of Census data and we are proud that our products will play an important role in driving quality to this critical initiative while safeguarding the privacy and security of this data.\",\n",

We issued $7 billion of new term debt, retired $3 billion of maturing debt and reduced commercial paper by $4 billion during the quarter, leaving us with total debt of $108 billion.

       "    \"Thank you. Good afternoon and congratulations on the quarter. iPhone revenue trajectory did improve, but it's still declined 9%. So can you talk about the drivers that will allow you to get that category back to growth. And if you think that's something that's realistic to expect in fiscal '20?\",\n",
       "    \"Katy, it's Tim. We are very thrilled with what we're seeing in early going on iPhone 11 and iPhone 11 Pro and Pro Max. It's early but the trends look very good. So I don't want to make a long-range forecast here. We've put our current thinking in the guidance and you can tell from the guidance we are bullish.\",\n",
       "    'Great. And Luca on margins guidance is consistent with September, but there is a lot going on under the covers; tariffs could expand in mid-December; there is some impact from the TV+ bundle; you have some big currency in commodity price move. So can you just talk about the gives and takes that land you at the December quarter gross margin guidance?',\n",
       "    \"On a year-over-year basis, we are also about flat. And on one side, we've got better commodity pricing, the environment is better than it was a year ago, but foreign exchange is a negative impact of 120 basis points on a year-over-year basis.\",\n",
       "    'Thank you, Katy. Can we have the next question please?',\n",
       "    'Our next question will be from Mike Olson with Piper Jaffray.',\n",
       "    \"Good afternoon, and thanks for taking my questions. So Wearables category has been strong, and it's hard to believe it's now essentially the same size as Mac. But related to Apple's initiatives in healthcare, do you think health-related features are a primary driver of Wearables growth and maybe conversely how important is a rising installed base of Wearables and the data that's associated with that to the ongoing innovation within Apple health? And then I have a follow-up.\",\n",
       "    \"Michael, it's Tim. The Wearables have done extremely well. It was acceleration further from the previous quarter. So we're thrilled with the results as to what's driving it. It's the totality that's driving it. For some people, it's about fitness; for some people, it's about health; for some other people, it's about communication; and for some people, it's all of the above. And I think the new feature of Always-On on Series 5 is a game changer for many of our users.\",\n",
       "    \"And in terms of other health-related things that we have going, we will be continuing to build out our health records connection into the health app, really democratizes the information about people's health, and so they can easily go from doctor to doctor. We've got the research going that I had mentioned earlier, there will be more of those through time, and obviously we've got things that we're not going to talk about just yet that we're working on. But as I've said before, my view is there will be a day in the future that we look back, and Apple's greatest contribution will be to people's health.\",\n",
       "    'Okay, thanks. And then with the strong slate of content in Apple TV+, can you just talk about the strategy behind giving it away to those that are buying in applicable device versus charging for it? And my congrats to Nancy, and thank you.',\n",
       "    'Thanks, Mike. Can we have the next question please?',\n",
       "    \"That will come from Evercore's Amit Daryanani.\",\n",
       "    \"Yes. Thanks a lot guys. I guess two questions from me as well. First one, Tim, if you think about the Services business, less than $2 billion away from the targets you had laid out a few years back. But I'm wondering if you think about the growth rates you've had in the business over the last several years, the high-teens average, I think, how much of that do you think was driven by the installed base growing versus incremental monetization of the installed base. And do you see that ratio essentially flipping or changing as you go forward?\",\n",
       "    \"Got it. And if I was just kind of go back to the variables discussion, especially as I think about Apple Watch and AirPods, is there a central way to think about what's the attach rate today to iOS devices for Apple Watch and AirPod update. I just want to understand if I think about 900 million plus iPhone installed base, what kind of penetration do you have at Wearables and how long could this one maybe as you go forward?\",\n",
       "    'Thank you, Amit. Could we have the next question please?',\n",
       "    'That will come from Shannon Cross with Cross Research.',\n",
       "    \"Thank you very much. First, Nancy, just want to send you our best wishes. We will definitely miss you. I'm sure, I agree with Luca, you've been very instrumental over the years.\",\n",
       "    'Thank you.',\n",
       "    \"Secondly, the products have been extremely well received there. Third, the things that we've done from a pricing and monthly payments point of view and trade-in, getting the trade-in program up and running, all of these things have had moved the dial. And so it's sort of the sum of all of that. I would also say, it's not all about iPhone in China, the services area grew double digit. We began to see more gaming approvals in the quarter, or I should say some key gaming approvals. It's not all about quantity, but about which ones, we saw that. Also Wearables, Wearables are doing so great at a company level. They're doing even better in China. And so lots of positives there.\",\n",
       "    \"Thank you. And then, I'm curious, Luca, maybe you can talk a bit about how you think about operating expense growth. It continues to grow significantly faster than revenue. So I'm just curious as to where you're targeting the incremental spend? And then, is there a point at which we might just see some leverage? Thank you.\",\n",
       "    \"Well, you know, Shannon, we've gone through different cycles. In some cases, our revenue growth exceeds our OpEx growth. In other cases, like fiscal '19, it was the other way around. But our approach frankly is not changing over time. We want to invest in the business. Our primary investments during the last few years have been in the R&D space, because obviously we want to continue to innovate, improve the user experience differentiate our products.\",\n",
       "    \"We continue to run SG&A tightly. Obviously, if you look at what we had launched in the last few quarters and few years, we launched a lot of new products, and now we are launching a lot of new services. And when we do that we need to make the adequate investments in marketing and advertising to raise the awareness of the new products and new services and that is what you're seeing for example in the guidance that we provided for the first quarter as we're launching new services right now, and so we're making investments both in engineering and in advertising to support the new launches.\",\n",
       "    'Thank you, Shannon. Could we have the next question please?',\n",
       "    \"That will come from Bernstein's Toni Sacconaghi.\",\n",
       "    \"Yes, thank you. I think this is for Luca, and then I have a follow-up as well. If I look at your guidance, the midpoint of your guidance for revenues on a sequential basis, it's up about 36.5%. Historically, fiscal Q4 to Q1 was up 50% or more, and even last year given that iPhone is a slower growing product, you guided for revenues to be up 45% sequentially. So given the enthusiasm about the iPhone 11 launch and the new Wearables products and the new services, I guess the question is, why is your guidance not stronger for Q1 on the top line? And is that sort of a reflection of conservatism given that there's a lot of uncertainty in the world and we certainly saw that last year? Or are there other forces at work that we should be considered?\",\n",
       "    \"Toni, thanks for the question. The guidance that we are providing if you look at it at the midpoint implies an acceleration of growth from the performance that we've seen during the course of fiscal 2019. As I said earlier, foreign exchange is clearly a headwind for us right now. This is about $1.1 billion of negative foreign exchange on a year-over-year basis. So that is something to keep in mind.\",\n",
       "    'We feel very good as Tim said about the iPhone, the way the new cycle has started, and we do expect an improvement in our year-over-year growth rate on iPhone. Wearables has very, very strong momentum. The portfolio of services also has incredible momentum. One thing to keep in mind as we look at this guidance range is the fact that we also contemplated the comparison to the launch of the iPad Pro, a year ago for iPad as well as the new MacBook Air that was launched during the December quarter last year. So for the iPad and Mac categories, you need to keep in mind that our launch timing is different on a year-over-year basis.',\n",
       "    \"On the bundle question, Toni, we look at each service, and decide what's best to do for it and with TV+, we concluded that a great way to get more people to see the content would be to do this, and it would be a good gift for our users. And so that's what we're doing. You can also see that on the other services we're not doing that. And so it's not part of a broader pattern, or although I wouldn't want to rule out for the future that we might not see another opportunity at some point in time.\",\n",
       "    \"In terms of hardware as a service or as a bundle, if you will, there are customers today that essentially view the hardware like that because they are on upgrade plans and so forth. And so to some degree that exists today, my perspective is that we will grow in the future to larger numbers that will grow disproportionately. And one of the things we are doing is trying to make it simpler and simpler for people to get on these sort of monthly financing kind of things. That's a part of what we announced with the Apple Card earlier in the call and so we are cognizant that there are lots of users out there that want sort of a recurring payment like that and the receipt of new products on some sort of standard kind of basis and we are committed to make that easier to do than perhaps it is today.\",\n",
       "    'Thank you, Toni. Could we have the next question please?',\n",
       "    'That will be from Chris Caso with Raymond James.',\n",
       "    \"Yes, thank you. Good afternoon. And Nancy, congratulations to you too, and we're going to miss you.\",\n",
       "    'Thank you.',\n",
       "    \"My first question is about pricing and the effect of some of the lower price points for iPhone 11 as compared to last year. And it looked like margins and revenues did well on that, and also followed some price adjustments you made in emerging markets last year, and obviously we've seen some improvement in China as well. So if you could talk about maybe what that tells us about pricing strategy in general and perhaps that you're willing to take a little more flexible approach to drive some elasticity if you think that's going to have a positive effect?\",\n",
       "    \"Yes, Chris, I think that the price moves we've made have been smart and well received and do show a level of elasticity, but the most important thing by far is the product. And I think we've got the best lineup we've ever had in the customer response to the product and what the product does for them is really incredible. And photos I am getting from many users around the world are just incredible that people are taking. And so I think it's product first, and then prices sort of falls out of that, and we did decide to be more aggressive. And looking at the results in the early going, I think it was the right call.\",\n",
       "    'In terms of emerging markets we picked sort of locally relevant prices, and in some cases where the dollar had become stronger, we took an exchange rate that would have reflected a while back, instead of the current exchange rate. And in other words, we tried to stay as close as we could to a local price point that we knew was effective for that particular market. And those in addition to the U.S. price that has gotten more of a discussion had been extremely well received.',\n",
       "    \"We are paying some tariffs today as you know, some that went into effect pre-September, and some others that went into effect in September. So we are paying some that's been comprehended. But in general, my view is very positive in terms of how things are going, and that positive view is obviously factored in our guidance as well. And just the tone I think has changed significantly and I have long thought that it was in both countries, best interests to get to an agreement that may be initially doesn't solve everything but solves some things that each party may want and get to a better place than where we're at and I'm hopeful that that's where we're headed.\",\n",

At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Nancy Paxton, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.',\n",
       "    \"Thank you. Good afternoon and thanks to everyone for joining us today. Speaking first is Apple's CEO, Tim Cook, and he'll be followed by CFO, Luca Maestri. And after that we'll open the call to questions from analysts. Please note that some of the information you'll hear during our discussion today will consist of forward-looking statements including, without limitation, those regarding revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, other income and expense, taxes, capital allocation and future business outlook. Actual results or trends could differ materially from our forecast.\",\n",
       "    \"For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in Apple's most recently filed periodic reports on Form 10-K and Form 10-Q, and Form 8-K filed with the SEC today, along with the associated press release. Apple assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements or information which speak as of their respective dates.\",\n",
       "    \"I'd now like to turn the call over to Tim for introductory remarks.\",\n",
       "    \"Thank you, Nancy. Good afternoon, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. We're thrilled to report a return to growth and a new June quarter revenue record of $53.8 billion. We saw significant improvement in year-over-year iPhone performance compared to last quarter, very strong performances for both Mac and iPad, and absolutely blow out quarter for wearables where we had accelerating our growth of well over 50%, and a new high watermark for services where we set an all-time revenue record of $11.5 billion. When you step back and consider wearables and services together, two areas where we have strategically invested in the last several years, they now approach the size of a Fortune 50 company.\",\n",
       "    \"Geographically, we are happy with our performance across the board including, a return to growth in Mainland China. We accomplished these results despite strong headwinds from foreign exchange, which impacted our top line growth rate by 300 basis points compared to a year ago. That's equivalent to about $1.5 billion of revenue.\",\n",
       "    \"Importantly, in constant currency, our revenue grew in all five of our geographic segments. For iPhone, we generated $26 billion in revenue. While this is down 12% from last year's June quarter, it is a significant improvement to the 17% year-over-year decline in Q2. We are encouraged by the results we're seeing from the initiatives that we spoke about in January, including strong customer response to our in-store trade-in and financing programs. In fact, iPhone in our retail and online stores returned to growth on a year-over-year basis in the month of June. Our active, installed base of iPhone reached a new all-time high and was up year-over-year in each of our top 20 markets, underscoring the quality of our products and the satisfaction and loyalty of iPhone customers around the world.\",\n",
       "    \"Revenue excluding iPhone was up 17% from last year with growth across all categories. Starting with services, we generated all-time record revenue of $11.5 billion, that's up 13% year-over-year and if we exclude the $236 million favorable one-time item from the June quarter last year, services growth was 15%, or 18% in constant currency, which is consistent with our Q2 performance.\",\n",
       "    \"Our strong services performance was broad-based. We set a new all-time records for AppleCare, Music, cloud services, and our App Store search ad business and we achieved a new third quarter revenue record for the App Store. What's more, we had double-digit services revenue growth in all five of our geographic segments. We surpassed 420 million paid subscriptions to services across our platform, and we remain on track to double our fiscal year 16 Services revenue in 2020.\",\n",
       "    \"In May, we launched our all-new Apple TV app in over 100 countries, bringing together all the ways to watch TV in a single app across iPhone, iPad, Apple TV, and select smart TVs. Monthly viewers in the Apple TV app in the United States are up over 40% year-over-year. We've seen our success being driven here by several factors. First, the fact that we have been able to integrate content from over a 150 leading content providers all in one place. Second, the same ease of use and unmatched user interface that sits Apple apart in other categories sets us apart in TV as well. And third, we're benefiting from a broader secular move to over-the-top services.\",\n",
       "    \"We're engaging with the third trend in five ways. Our Apple TV hardware, Apple TV channels where customers can choose to pay only for the channels they want, our massive library of over a 100,000 iTunes movies and TV shows, the App Store where users can find their favorite streaming services and later this year, our original programming service, Apple TV Plus. Apple Pay is now completing nearly 1 billion transactions per month, more than twice the volume of the year-ago. Apple Pay launched in 17 countries in the June quarter, completing our coverage in the European Union and bringing us to a total of 47 markets currently. Based on June quarter performance, Apple Pay is now adding more new users than PayPal, and monthly transaction volume is growing four times as fast. In the United States, in addition to a successful integration into Portland's transit system in May, we're beginning the rollout of New York City Transit, and we'll launch in Chicago later this year.\",\n",
       "    \"In China, Apple Pay launched the payment card for DiDi, the world's largest ride hailing provider. As I've said before, transit integration is a major driver of a broader digital wallet adoption and we're going to keep up this push to help users leave their wallet at home in more and more instances. On a related note, thousands of Apple employees are using Apple Card every day in our beta test, and we plan to begin the rollout of Apple Card in August.\",\n",
       "    'As I mentioned at the outset, it was another sensational quarter for wearables, with growth accelerating to well over 50%. We had great results for Apple Watch, which set a new June quarter revenue record and is reaching millions of new users. Over 75% of customers buying Apple Watch in the June quarter were buying their first Apple Watch. We continue to see phenomenal demand for AirPods, and when you tally up the last four quarters, our Wearables business is now bigger than 60% of the companies in the Fortune 500.',\n",
       "    \"We had great performance from iPad with revenue of over $5 billion and growth driven by iPad Pro, and by strong customer response to the new iPad mini and iPad Air. This was our third consecutive quarter of growth and with revenue up 15% year-to-date, we feel great about where we're headed with iPad. With our current lineup of iPad, iPad Mini, iPad Air, and iPad Pro, we've got the perfect device for everyone from young learners to professionals.\",\n",
       "    \"We were also very happy with double-digit revenue growth from Mac, fueled by a strong performance of MacBook Air and MacBook Pro. Looking forward, there is an enormous amount to be excited about for Mac. On the heels of our Mac Mini and iMac updates earlier in the fiscal year, we brought significant updates to the bulk of our notebook line up in the last couple of months. We now have a $999 MacBook Air that is killer for college students, and for our pro users who push the limits of what a Mac can do, we were thrilled unveiled the most powerful Mac ever, the new Mac Pro and the all-new Pro display XDR, which will be available this fall. They're designed for maximum performance, expansion, and configurability, and at breakthrough pricing, and they are the most powerful tools Apple has ever put in the hands of Pro customers. What's more, the Mac ecosystem as a whole is about to get a big boost. At our recent Worldwide Developers Conference, we announced a game-changing tool to help developers easily adapt their iOS and iPad iOS apps for the Mac. I'll have a bit more to say on that in a moment.\",\n",
       "    \"I'd like to provide some color on our performance in Greater China, where we saw significant improvement compared to the first half of fiscal 2019 and return to growth in constant currency. We experienced noticeably better year-over-year comparisons for our iPhone business there than we saw in the last two quarters, and we had sequential improvement in the performance of every category. The combined effects of government stimulus, consumer response to trade-in programs, financing offers, and other sales initiatives, and growing engagement with the broader Apple ecosystem had a positive effect. We were especially pleased with a double-digit increase in services driven by strong growth from the App Store in China.\",\n",
       "    \"Turning to the future. Last week, we announced an agreement with Intel to acquire the majority of it smartphone modem business. This is our second-largest acquisition by dollars, and our largest ever in terms of staff. We're looking forward to welcoming all of them to Apple. We see this is a great opportunity to work with some of the leading talents in this field, to grow our portfolio of wireless technology patents to over 7,000, to expedite our development of our future products, and to further our long-term strategy of owning and controlling the primary technologies behind the products that we make.\",\n",
       "    'We also had our best WWDC ever last month, packed with announcements of great new features coming this fall across our four software platforms, making them more powerful, more personal, and more private. For iPhone users, iOS 13 will take on a dramatic new look with dark mode, while delivering major updates to the apps you use every day including photos, camera, and maps. iOS 13 offers great new ways to help you manage your privacy and security, including sign-on with Apple, which uses Face ID or Touch ID to quickly sign into apps and websites without sharing your personal information. And improvements across the entire system will make iPhone even faster and more delightful to use than ever before.',\n",
       "    'For the first time, iPad is getting its own version of iOS called iPadOS, a strategic step forward that takes the iPad experience to a whole new level. The redesigned home screen, powerful new multitasking tools, and deeper integration with Apple Pencil take productivity and creativity further, including using your iPad as an extended an interactive second monitor for your Mac. For Apple TV, TvOS 13 will make the big screen experience even more personal. With a redesigned home screen and multi-user support, everyone in the family can get a more engaging and tailored experience with their favorite TV shows, movies, sports, and news, along with Apple music photos and videos in iCloud, and an App Store with thousands of great games and apps.',\n",
       "    \"WatchOS 6 is a major step forward in helping Apple Watch users stay healthy, active, and connected. Apple Watch now has a dedicated App Store that users can access directly from the device, and new watch faces, Siri enhancements, and music and audio features make Apple Watch more useful than ever. And of course, we continue to innovate on Apple Watch's promise to be an intelligent guardian for your health. WatchOS 6 includes powerful new features like notifications that warned about high-decibel noise to protect your hearing, and cycle tracking to aid in women's healthcare decisions.\",\n",
       "    \"In the June quarter, we expanded the availability of the ECG app and irregular rhythm notifications to five additional European countries, and added Canada and Singapore just last week, making them available in 31 countries and regions around the world with more to come later this year. We're very proud of the muscle we've built in bringing regulated products like these to market. This is an important competency that creates exciting opportunities for us moving forward.\",\n",
       "    'As I noted earlier, we believe Mac OS Catalina will be a breakthrough in the Mac ecosystem. A new tool included in Mac OS Catalina called Mac Catalyst gives developers a major head start in bringing their iOS apps to the Mac. Thousands of developers are already using it to bring their apps to the Mac ecosystem, and we expect to see a wave the popular apps arriving for the Mac as early as this fall.',\n",
       "    \"Again as we're taking a step back and digesting the bigger picture here, these updates of the latest steps in a broader strategic effort to make the user experience across iOS, Mac OS, iPad OS, Watch OS and TvOS more effort effortless, and more intuitive. Apple is alone in offering this kind of value and ecosystem to its customers, and these devices and their platforms are unmatched in their ease of use, their seamlessness, and their privacy and security. And while providing these things, we've created a dynamic environment where a developer benefits benefit greatly from creating for, and distributing on these platforms. And our customers of course benefit greatly from access to all this creativity and innovation.\",\n",
       "    'We also unveiled other exciting technologies to make it easier and faster for developers to create powerful new apps. SwiftUI provides an intuitive new framework for building sophisticated user interfaces across our software platforms using simple, easy to use, code. Core ML3 supports the acceleration of more types of advanced real-time machine learning models and Create ML lets developers build machine learning models without writing code.',\n",
       "    \"We have the world's largest augmented-reality-enabled platform, and thousands of AR Kit enabled applications in the App Store. Building on this strategy, and our momentum in this area, we introduced three new AR-based technologies. ARKit 3 uses on-device, real-time machine learning to recognize the human form and integrates people seamlessly into AR experiences. Reality Kit is a new developer framework built from the ground-up to provide all the tools and technologies required to make AR objects virtually life=like. And Reality Composer brings AR content creation to tens of millions of developers who had no 3-D experience. Our developers are already running with these new technologies and we think our customers are going to love some of the apps these creators have in store in the months ahead.\",\n",
       "    \"On so many fronts, there is an enormous amount to look forward to over the next few months, including the launch of new services, like Apple Arcade, Apple TV Plus, and Apple Card. And without giving too much away, we have several new products that we can't wait to share with you. Until then, thanks for joining us today and for more details on the June quarter results, I'll turn the call over to Luca.\",\n",
       "    'Thank you, Tim. Good afternoon, everyone. We are happy to report the June quarter revenue record of $53.8 billion, up 1% year-over-year. We returned to growth in spite of a difficult foreign exchange environment around the world, which impacted our year-over-year growth rate by 300 basis points. We set June quarter revenue records in the Americas, in Japan, and the rest of Asia Pacific. And as Tim mentioned earlier, all our geographic segments grew in constant currency.',\n",
       "    'Overall products revenue was $42.4 billion, down 2% year-over-year, which is significantly better than the 8% decline in product revenue that we experienced during the first half of the fiscal year. Product categories outside of iPhone grew 20%, with strong results in wearables, Mac, and iPad. Services revenue grew 13% to a new all-time record of $11.5 billion. Excluding the one-time item we highlighted a year ago in connection with the final resolution of various lawsuits, services revenue growth was 16%, and 18% in constant currency terms.',\n",
       "    'On a geographic basis, we saw a marked improvement in our year-over-year comparisons from emerging markets relative to the first half of this fiscal year, particularly in the BRIC countries where year-over-year performance went from a 25% revenue decline in the first half to 3% growth in the June quarter. We set June quarter revenue records in several major developed markets including the US, Canada, Germany, France, Japan, Australia, and Korea. In emerging markets, we returned to growth in Mainland China, grew strong double digits in India and in Brazil, and we set new Q3 records in Thailand, Vietnam, and the Philippines.',\n",
       "    'Company gross margin was 37.6%, flat sequentially, and in line with our guidance. Products gross margin was 30.4%, down about 80 basis points sequentially due to seasonal loss of leverage and product mix, partially offset by favorable cost. Services gross margin was 64.1%, up 30 basis points sequentially, primarily due to a favorable mix. Net income was $10 billion diluted earnings per share were $2.18, and operating cash flow was $11.6 billion.',\n",
       "    'Let me get into more detail for each of our revenue categories. iPhone revenue was $26 billion, down 12% compared to a year ago. This was significantly better year-over-year performance than last quarter, 17% decline with sequential improvement in year-over-year comparisons in 15 of our top 20 markets.',\n",
       "    'Our active installed base of iPhone continued to grow to a new all-time high in each of our geographic segments, and in the US, the latest survey of consumers from 451 Research indicates iPhone customer satisfaction of 99% for iPhone XR, iPhone XS, and XS Max combined. Among business buyers who plan to purchase smartphones in the September quarter, 83% plan to purchase iPhones.',\n",
       "    'Turning to services, we reached an all-time revenue record in spite of foreign exchange headwinds with double-digit growth from the App Store, Apple Music, cloud services, and AppleCare, and triple-digit growth from Apple Pay and our App Store search ad business. All geographic segments had double-digit growth in services revenue and set new June quarter records, with all-time records in the Americas and rest of Asia Pacific. In total, services accounted for 21% of upward revenue and 36% of gross margin dollars.',\n",
       "    'Customer engagement in our ecosystem continues to grow. The number of transacting accounts on our digital content stores reached a new all-time high in the June quarter, and the number of paid accounts grew strong double digits compared to last year. We now have over 420 million paid subscriptions across the services on our platforms, and we are well on our way to our goal of surpassing the 500 million mark during 2020. On the App Store, our growth accelerated sequentially. Our subscription business continues to grow strongly and is extremely diversified across many categories such entertainment, lifestyle, photo and video, and music. Third-party subscription revenue grew by over 40% and across all third-party subscription apps the largest accounted for only 0.25% of total services revenue.',\n",
       "    'Among our many services records, it was our best quarter ever for AppleCare. We are seeing an increase in service contract attach rates, and are expanding distribution of AppleCare through our partners. We also recently expanded our authorized service provider network, and nearly 1,000 Best Buy stores across the US are now offering expert service and repairs for Apple products. This expansion provides customers with an even more convenient access to repairs using parts certified for safety, quality, and reliability. In addition to our retail stores, that are over 1,800 third-party Apple Authorized Service Providers in the US, which is three times as many locations as three years ago.',\n",
       "    \"Next I'd like to talk about the Mac. Revenue was $5.8 billion, up 11% compared to last year. Mac revenue grew in four of our five geographic segments, and set June quarter records in the US, Europe, and Japan, as our overall market performance significantly outpace the global PC industry. Nearly half of the customers purchasing Macs during the quarter were new to Mac, with revenue growing in both developed and emerging markets and the active installed base of Macs again reached a new all-time high.\",\n",
       "    'We also had great results for iPad with $5 billion in revenue, up 8%. iPad revenue grew in all five of our geographic segments, with a Q3 revenue record in Mainland China and double digit growth in emerging markets. In total, over half of the customers purchasing iPads during the June quarter were new to iPad, and the iPad active installed base also reached a new all-time high.',\n",
       "    'The most recent surveys from 451 Research measured a 94% customer satisfaction rating for iPad from consumers and among business customers who plan to purchase tablets in the September quarter, 75% plan to purchase iPads. Wearables, home and accessories revenue accelerated across all our geographic segments, growing 48% to over $5.5 billion, and setting a June quarter record. This growth was fueled primarily by the strong performance of our Wearables business, which was up well over 50% and has become the size of a Fortune 200 company over the last 12 months. In addition, we generated double-digit revenue growth from Apple TV and Accessories during the quarter.',\n",
       "    'Our retail and online stores produced our best June quarter revenue ever with double-digit revenue growth across Apple Watch, iPad, Mac and Accessories our trade-in program is showing great momentum with more than five times the number of iPhones traded in compared to a year ago. We opened stunning new stores in the Carnegie Library in Washington DC and the business Shinji district in Taipei, as well as a beautiful new location in the Dallas Galleria.',\n",
       "    'We ended the quarter with 506 physical stores in 22 countries, alongside our online store presence in 35 countries. In the enterprise market, we are gaining traction with our strategy of transforming major industries by expanding our leading positions in key functional areas to grow our reach and modernize customer and employee experiences. In the financial services industry, 90 of the largest 100 banks by asset size are deploying Apple products to improve efficiency and effectiveness across their organizations.',\n",
       "    \"iPhone and iPad are overwhelmingly the preferred mobile devices for bankers on the go. For example, 60% of the biggest banks are supporting iPads for wealth managers. In retail banking, two-thirds of top banks at deploying iPad for branch transformation and modernizing legacy interfaces with a unified iPad experience. One of the world's largest banks created an iPad suite that reduced customer onboarding time from more than an hour to just 12 minutes. Bank branch employees are also using Apple Watch for communication and notifications and Apple TV for customer presentations from iPads using AirPlay. Financial institutions also tell us they receive positive feedback from leveraging Apple solutions for direct customer engagement. American Express, Credit Suisse, Discover, and TD Ameritrade have launched Apple Business Chat as a dynamic way to support and interact with customers. The intuitive interface of messages on iOS enables rich communication between customers and contact center staff. TD Ameritrade as also become the first brokerage in the world to enable immediate funding of accounts using Apple Pay, eliminating the two to three business days it used to take to fund accounts by wire transfer.\",\n",
       "    'Let me now turn to our cash position. We ended the quarter with almost $211 billion in cash plus marketable securities. We retired $3 billion of term debt and reduced commercial paper by $2 billion during the quarter, leaving us with total debt of $108 billion. As a result, net cash was $102 billion at the end of the quarter, and we continue on our path to reaching a net cash neutral position over time.',\n",
       "    \"We returned over $21 billion to shareholders during the quarter, including $17 billion through open market repurchases of almost $88 million Apple shares and $3.6 billion in dividends and equivalents. As we move ahead into the September quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy referred to, at the beginning of the call.\",\n",
       "    \"We expect revenue to be between $61 billion and $64 billion. This guidance includes almost $1 billion of the year-over-year negative impact from foreign exchange. We expect gross margin to be between 37.5% and 38.5%. We expect OpEx to be between $8.7 billion and $8.8 billion. We expect Y&E to be about $200 million and we expect our tax rate to be about 16.5%. Also today, our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.77 per share of common stock, payable on August 15, 2019, to shareholders of record as of August 12, 2019. With that I'd like to open the call to questions.\",\n",
       "    'Questions and Answers:',\n",
       "    'Thank you, Luca. And we ask that you limit yourself to two questions. Operator, may we have the first question please.',\n",
       "    'The first question will come from Amit Daryanani from Evercore.',\n",
       "    \"Fair enough, that's really helpful. And I guess if I just follow-up on China, I'm impressed to see the continued recovery you guys are seeing there, despite all the headlines that are out there. Just curious, what are the few things that are driving the success in China, and how sustainable do you think this changes out for Apple as you go forward?\",\n",
       "    'Thank you, Amit. Can we have the next question please?',\n",
       "    'And that question will come from Shannon Cross with Cross Research.',\n",
       "    \"I would say, I'll give you a bit more color around two offsetting factors around this performance during the June quarter. On one side, the App Store, I mentioned in my prepared remarks that growth accelerated sequentially. We had double-digit growth on the App Store in every geography. In China, we saw significant acceleration. As you know, we tend to monetize in China on the App Store through game titles, and the government has approved a few key game titles during the quarter. That has helped our performance there.\",\n",
       "    \"We set a target of surpassing 0.5 billion paid subscriptions on the ecosystem during 2020. We are already at 420 million now, so we feel confident there. And of course, as you mentioned, we're very excited about the fact that we're going to be launching new services soon. As Tim said, we are starting the rollout of Apple Card in August, and there's two more very important services that we're going to be adding to our portfolio during the fall. One is Apple Arcade, which is our gaming subscription service and of course, Apple TV Plus, which is our video streaming service. So obviously these services will help us carry on with the momentum that we have in services.\",\n",
       "    'Great, thank you. And then this is probably for you too as well, Luca. Can you talk about gross margin? The guidance was pretty solid. Obviously there are various things that are at play here. I know you mentioned $1 billion worth of top line impact I think from currency next quarter, but maybe if you can kind of talk about what went into your gross margin guidance? Thanks.',\n",
       "    \"Yeah. So, of course, Shannon, as you've seen, our guidance for margin is 50 basis points higher than the guidance that we had given for June. I would say on the positive, we expect to benefit from leverage, as you've seen from our revenue guidance, and from cost savings because as you know, the commodity environment is fairly favorable right now. On the negative side, the headwind on gross margins on a year-over-year basis from foreign exchange is about 100 basis points. And so we need to keep that in mind, but we feel pretty good about the guidance we provided.\",\n",
       "    'Thanks, Shannon. Could we have the next question please?',\n",
       "    'Our next question will come from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley.',\n",
       "    \"Yes, thank you. I'd like to go back to the discussion around strength in China in the quarter, and understand what linearity looked like. I ask because there was some industry data around the smartphone market in China that seem to deteriorate in the month of June. The App Store data deteriorated a little bit in June, and just curious if that's something you saw on the business, and if it at all informs your outlook around the pace of the China business as you go into September?\",\n",
       "    \"Katy it's Tim. We obviously took into account all of the information that we had in coming up with the guidance, including the linearity across last quarter and how this quarter has started. And so, we obviously look at that in quite much detail.\",\n",
       "    \"And then just on the App Store, I appreciate there's not a lot of detail out around exact timing and even some pricing of the new services, but how should we think about the new services that launched in March impacting the overall services growth? Does that start to benefit the model in the back half of this calendar year? Or will the impact to be more longer-term in nature and really show up in 2020?\",\n",
       "    'Thank you, Katie. Could we have the next question please?',\n",
       "    'That question will come from Krish Sankar with Cowen & Company.',\n",
       "    'Yeah, hi, thanks for taking my question, I have two of them. First one, on the iPhone trade-in program, how effective was it and what percentage of the iPhone sales came from the trade-ins? And are there any other geographies where you left to roll it out? And then I had a follow-up.',\n",
       "    \"Hi, it's Tim. In retail, it was quite successful. We got going in a larger way during that quarter. We were pretty much just ramping in the previous quarter. And trade-in as a percentage of their total sales is significant, and financing is a key element of it. Those two things in the aggregate led retail, the combination retail and online. We just short-formed that as retail. Apple Store led to growth in June and so we feel very, very good about the trajectory. We are obviously taking those programs and advocating those more widely, and that is that different levels of implementation throughout different geographies. We're working with our carrier partners on those, and retail partners.\",\n",
       "    \"Well, there are elements today that are not necessarily tethered to iPhone, right? We have other products, where people are purchasing things, they're watching Apple TV, we offer Apple Music on Android. And so there is a series of things that are outside of that, and so we'll see what we do in the future. I don't want to really get in, get into that. But more broadly, to answer your question about growth as we go forward, the way I see it as we had the strongest hardware portfolio ever. We've got new products on the way. The pipeline is full of great new stuff both on the product and the services side. We're very fortunate and have worked very hard to have loyal customers, and to continue tracking an impressive number of switchers.\",\n",
       "    \"At the same time on the market side, we have emerging markets where we have low penetration and during the quarter tactically, emerging markets had a bit of a rebound. In fact on a constant currency basis, we actually grew slightly in emerging markets. We still declined on a reported basis. India bounced back during the quarter. We returned to growth there. We are very happy with that. We grew in Brazil as well. We are also continuing to focus on the enterprise market. Luca mentioned some of this in his comments, and we think that continues to be a big opportunity for us. And then we've got lots of what I would call core technology kinds of things like augmented reality, where we are placing big bets and I think we have a big future in addition to the health kinds of things that may fall out of the Watch.\",\n",
       "    'Thank you, Chris. We have the next question please?',\n",
       "    \"Next we'll go to Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.\",\n",
       "    'Yes. Thank you, Tim. The China trade situation remains sort of fluid over here and recently, more recently, you asked for some tariff exceptions, were not granted those. How are you thinking about the longer-term footprint for manufacturing? And can you talk about any potential alternatives that you looked at and considered in moving parts of production potentially out of China? And I have a follow-up.',\n",
       "    \"Yeah, I know there's been a lot of speculation around the topic of different moves and so forth. I wouldn't put a lot of stock into those if I were you. The way that I view this is the vast majority of our products are kind of made everywhere. There is a significant level of content in the United States, and a lot from Japan to Korea to China, and the European Union also contributes a fair amount. And so that's the nature of a global supply chain. I think, largely I think that will carry the day in the future as well. In terms of the exclusions, we've been making the Mac Pro in the US, and we want to continue doing that. And so we are working and investing currently in capacity to do so, because we want to continue to be here. And so that's what's behind the exclusions. And so, we're explaining that and hope for a positive outcome.\",\n",
       "    'Okay. Thanks, Tim. And there is, Luca maybe for you. There has been some significant de-stocking of inventory in the first calendar half of this year and iPhone. Can you comment about the broader channel inventory levels, where you are in your typical ranges, especially given the comment around June iPhone sales being quite strong? And do you expect anything atypical in channel inventory dynamics in the September quarter? Thank you.',\n",
       "    \"Yes Wamsi, as you know, we are not getting into this topic very much but I think I can give you some color here. You know that in general we decrease our inventory during the March quarter and the June quarter? That has been traditionally what we've done. This year, we reduced channel inventory for iPhone slightly more than last year and that is true in total, and it's true for Greater China as well. So we feel very good about our channel inventory ranges as we get into the September quarter. I hope that helps you with that.\",\n",
       "    'Thank you, Wamsi, can we have the next question please?',\n",
       "    'Our next question comes from Jim Suva with Citigroup.',\n",
       "    'Thanks very much. The first question is probably for Tim, and the second one for Luca, and I will offer them at the same time. So you can pick and choose whichever one wants to answer first or second. So the first question Tim, regarding the installed base comment you made, which is quite encouraging, but yet when you look at the iPhone revenue year-over-year, over the past several quarters has been down. Can you help us bridge the gap of how is the installed base is growing? Is it mostly because like secondary users are the new ones coming into the system? Are people holding their phones longer? And what does that user typically bring in with them, or is something unique relative to what we historically know?',\n",
       "    \"And then for Luca, you been investing a lot, a lot, lot, lot. And a lot of these services are now coming to pass, whether it be AppleCare, Apple Cloud, all these wearables, and soon Apple Pay and Arcade. Are we we at a point where now a lot of harvesting is going to happen? Or do you kind of continue this is relatively same investment that you've been doing for the future strategy? Thank you.\",\n",
       "    \"And, Jim, on OpEx. Obviously it's very important for us to continue to invest in the business, particularly on the R&D side because we were always want to bring more innovation into the market. We want to improve the user experience and differentiate our products and services in the marketplace. So we will continue to do that. There are some type types of investments, of course, that are very strategic for us and they will have long-term implications. You've seen the announcement that we made around the Intel acquisition, very important strategically for us. It requires upfront investment, of course. As you've seen from this quarter and also from the past, we will continue to run our SG&A portion of OpEx tightly. We will of course, will continue to invest in marketing and advertising.\",\n",
       "    'Thank you, Jim, could we have the next question please?',\n",
       "    'The next question will come from Samik Chatterjee with JP Morgan.',\n",
       "    'Hi, thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to start off with the announcement of the WWDC around the independent App Stores for the Watch and the iPads. What level of interest have you seen from developers and how are they thinking about the ability to monetize services independently on those App Stores? And how does it help you position Wearables more firmly into the health and fitness category?',\n",
       "    \"Got it. If I can just follow-up on the China market. One of the things that we're looking at is with the going into the new year into 2020 there'll be a lot of 5G phones launching in that market from the Android players. How you think about the competitive landscape there as you enter next year?\",\n",

       "    \"Thanks, Nancy. Good afternoon and thanks to all of you for joining us today. This has been an exciting and productive quarter for Apple. In my letter to investors at the beginning of January, I wrote that one of the Apple's great strengths is our culture of flexibility, adaptability and creativity. This quarter featured some important announcements that speak to the power of our commitment to innovation and long-term thinking. I'd like to start with some top-line highlights and then move into greater detail with you.\",\n",
       "    \"I'll get started with financial results. Our revenue was $58 billion, toward the high end of our guidance range. We see this result as a positive outcome in light of ongoing headwinds from weaker foreign currencies relative to the US dollar. In constant currency, our year-over-year revenue performance would have been 200 basis points better than our reported results indicate. We had great results in a number of areas across our business. It was our best quarter ever for Services with revenue reaching $11.5 billion. We had a blockbuster quarter for iPad, with revenue up 22% from a year ago; this is our highest iPad revenue growth rate in six years. And it was another sensational quarter for wearables with growth near 50%. This business is now about the size of a Fortune 200 company, an amazing statistic when you consider it's only been four years since we delivered the very first Apple Watch. I'll talk more about these categories later.\",\n",
       "    \"While we grew year-over-year and developed markets and while we had record March quarter results in a number of major markets, including the United States, Canada, United Kingdom and Japan, we did experience a revenue decline in emerging markets. But we feel positive about our trajectory. Our year-over-year revenue performance in Greater China improved relative to the December quarter and we've seen very positive customer response to the pricing actions we've taken in that market, our trading and financing programs in our retail stores, the effects of government measures to stimulate the economy and improved trade dialog between the United States and China. Our App Store results are still reflecting the impact of the slowdown in regulatory approval and gaming apps in China, but we are encouraged by the recent increase in the pace of approvals. We believe strongly in our long-term opportunity in China. Thanks to our robust ecosystem, our talented developer community and the country's growing population of tech savvy consumers who value the very best products and services.\",\n",
       "    \"For iPhone, while our worldwide revenue was down 17% from a year ago, declines were significantly smaller in the final weeks of the March quarter. Looking back at the past five months, November and December were the most challenging, so this is an encouraging trend. We like the direction we're headed with iPhone and our goal now is to pick up the pace. Importantly, our active installed base of devices continues to grow in each of our geographic segments and set a new all-time record for all major product categories. That growing installed base is a reflection of the satisfaction and loyalty of our customers and it's driving our Services business to new heights. In fact, we had our best quarter ever for the App Store, Apple Music, cloud services and our App Store search ad business and we set new March quarter revenue records for AppleCare and Apple Pay. Apple Pay transaction volume more than doubled year-over-year and we're on track to reach 10 billion transactions this calendar year. Apple Pay is now available in 30 markets and we expect to be live in 40 markets by the end of the year. More and more transit systems are accepting Apple Pay and New York's MTA system will begin the rollout in early summer. As we've seen in places like London, Tokyo and Shanghai contactless entry into transit systems helps to spur broader Apple Pay adoption and we believe this will get even more people using Apple Pay in the United States. And Ticketmaster has just announced that they will be accepting Apple Pay for ticket purchases on the web and through the Ticketmaster app and over 50 of their entertainment and sporting venues are launching contactless tickets this year, including the vast majority of NFL stadiums.\",\n",
       "    \"Subscriptions are powerful driver of our Services business. We reached a new high of over 390 million paid subscriptions at the end of March, an increase of 30 million in the last quarter alone. This is also an incredibly important quarter for our Services moving forward. In March, we previewed a game-changing array of new services, each of them rooted in principles that are fundamentally Apple. They're easy to use, they feature unmatched attention to detail, they put a premium on user privacy and security. They're expertly curated, personalized and ready to be shared by everyone in your family. These features aren't just nice to have, they actually help to eliminate the boundary between hardware, software and service creating a singularly exceptional experience for our users.\",\n",
       "    'First, building on the great momentum of Apple News, which is already the number one news app in the United States and the United Kingdom, we launched Apple News+. It will bring together over 30 popular magazines, leading newspapers and digital publishers into a beautiful, convenient and curated experience within the Apple News app. Apple News+ builds on our commitment to supporting quality journalism from trusted sources, while providing the best magazine and news reading experience ever for mobile devices.',\n",
       "    \"Advancing our vision to replace the wallet, we announced Apple Card, built on principles Apple stands for like transparency, simplicity and privacy. Apple Card is integrated into the wallet app and delivers all new experiences that only Apple can provide integrating our hardware, software and services in an elegant solution that places the customer at the center. It's the first card to encourage you to pay less interest, eliminate fees and give you daily cash on all your purchases and customer interest to date has been terrific.\",\n",
       "    \"We also previewed Apple Arcade, the world's first game subscription service for mobile, desktop and the living room. With over 100 new games, all with no ads or add tracking, no additional purchases and respect for user privacy, we've created a service for players of all ages, kids to teens to adults and one that families can enjoy together. The app stores is already the world's biggest gaming platform and we think Apple Arcade is a great way to unleash the creativity of the game developer community with the collection of new games, not available on any other mobile platform or in any other subscription service. We can't wait for our customers to experience it for themselves beginning this fall.\",\n",
       "    \"We were thrilled to provide a peek at what's new for TV. Beginning in mid-May, the all new Apple TV app will bring together the different ways to discover and watch shows, movies, sports news and more in one app across iPhone, iPad, Apple TV, Mac, smart TVs and streaming devices. And users can subscribe to and watch new Apple TV channels like HBO, Showtime and Stars paying only for services they want, all on demand available on and offline. And coming this fall, Apple TV+ will be the new home for the world's most creative story tellers, featuring exclusive original shows, movies and documentaries.\",\n",
       "    \"We also had several major product introductions during the quarter. We'd launched a new more powerful iMac with dramatic increases in both compute and graphics performance, making it a great update for consumers in Pros alive. For our Mac business overall, we faced some processor constraints in the March quarter, leading to a 5% revenue decline compared to last year. But we believe that our Mac revenue would have been up compared to last year without those constraints and don't believe this challenge will have a significant impact on our Q3 results.\",\n",
       "    \"For iPad, we were very happy to return to growth in Greater China, while generating strong double-digit growth in each of our other geographic segments. Our great iPad results were driven primarily by strong customer response to iPad Pro. Late in the quarter, we launched in all new iPad Air with an ultra-thin design, Apple Pencil support and high-end performance powered by Apple's A12 Bionic chip. In addition, we introduced a new iPad Mini, a major upgrade for iPad fans who love an ultra-portable design and like the new iPad Air it delivers the power of the A12 Bionic and support for Apple Pencil.\",\n",
       "    \"Last month, we introduced new AirPods, the second generation of the world's most popular wireless headphones and demand has been incredible. This is nothing less than a cultural phenomenon. With the new Apple design H1 chip, the new AirPods deliver faster connect times, more talk time and the convenience of hands-free Hey Siri.\",\n",
       "    \"Our retail and online stores continue to be a key point of innovation. As we mentioned in January, we've been working on an initiative to make it simple to trade in a phone and in our store, finance the purchase over time and get help transferring data from the old phone to the new phone. As part of this initiative, we've rolled out new trade-in and financing programs in the US, China, the UK, Spain, Italy and Australia. The results have been striking. Across our stores, we had an all-time record response to our trade-in programs and with more than four times the trade-in volume of our March quarter a year ago.\",\n",
       "    \"With each passing quarter, we are more inspired by the impact our products are having on people's fitness and health. This quarter, we brought the ECG app on Apple Watch Series 4 to Hong Kong and 19 European countries, including France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the UK. Just like when the ECG app launched in the United States, there's hardly a day that goes by that I don't get a letter or an email from a customer in one of these countries talking about how this feature has significantly changed their lives. We believe we're really just beginning to tap into what we can do to help our users actively manage their health and wellbeing. For example, last month, Stanford Medicine reported results of the Apple Heart Study, the largest study ever of its kind, which enrolled over 400,000 participants from all 50 states in a span of only eight months. And hundreds of institutions are now supporting health records on iPhone with recent additions including Michigan Medicine and UT Health Austin. In February, we announced that we are working with the US Department of Veterans Affairs to make health records on iPhone available to veterans. This will be the first record sharing platform of its kind available to the VA, which is the largest medical system in the US providing service to more than 9 million veterans across more than 1,200 facilities.\",\n",
       "    \"Apple's innovation extends beyond the impact we have in the lives of our customers to the impact we leave on the world around us. We've recently marked Earth Day with several major announcements about our efforts to leave the world better than we founded. We have completed the allocation of our $2.5 billion green bond proceeds across 40 environmental initiatives around the world to projects ranging from solar power generation to water conservation, to development of custom alloys for our products made from 100% recycled aluminum. We've announced a major expansion of our recycling programs including quadrupling the number of locations where US customers can send their iPhones to be disassembled by Daisy, our recycling robot. Each Daisy can now disassemble 1.2 million devices per year, allowing recovered materials to be recycled into the manufacturing process. And we partnered with a record number of our suppliers to follow our lead and transition to 100% clean energy. With the help of these 44 suppliers, we will exceed our goal of bringing 4 gigawatts of renewable energy into our supply chain by 2020 with over 1 additional gigawatt projected within that time frame. In the last calendar year alone, the partners that have joined this effort have generated enough clean energy to power over 600,000 homes in the United States. We are very proud of the progress that we and our partners are making and hope our actions will inspire other businesses to do what they can to protect the world that we share.\",\n",
       "    \"We are in the fortunate position of generating more cash than we need to run our business and it does confidently in our future. So today we're announcing the latest update to our capital return program including an increase to our share repurchase authorization and our quarterly dividend. For more details on that and our March quarter results, I'll turn the call over to Luca.\",\n",
       "    'Thank you, Tim. Good afternoon, everyone. Revenue in the March quarter was $58 billion, near the high end of the guidance range that we provided 90 days ago, and down 5% from last year. Our revenue decline reflects 200 basis points of negative foreign exchange due to the strength of the US dollar. Overall products revenue declined 9% driven primarily by iPhone, while Services revenue grew 16% to a new all-time record. We also set a new March quarter record for wearables, home and accessories, and we recorded our best iPad growth rate in six years.',\n",
       "    'Company gross margin was 37.6%, in line with our guidance. Products gross margin was 31.2%, down about 310 basis points sequentially due to the seasonal loss of leverage and headwinds from foreign exchange. Services gross margin was 63.8%, up 100 basis points sequentially due to a different mix and leverage from higher revenue. Net income was $11.6 billion. Diluted earnings per share were $2.46 and operating cash flow was $11.2 billion.',\n",
       "    \"Let me provide in more color for our various revenue categories; iPhone revenue was $31.1 billion. We're seeing positive customer response to recent pricing actions in certain emerging markets, as well as enhancements to our trade-in and financing programs and our year-over-year performance improved relative to our December quarter results in Greater China, in the Americas and in Japan. Our active installed base of iPhone reached a new all-time high at the end of March. This growing installed base reflects the industry leading satisfaction and loyalty of our customers. The latest survey of US consumers from 451 Research indicates customer satisfaction of 99% for iPhone XR, XS and XS Max combined. And among business buyers who plan to purchase smartphones in the June quarter, 81% plan to purchase iPhones.\",\n",
       "    'Turning to Services, as Tim said, it was our best quarter ever with $11.5 billion in revenue, an increase of 16% from last year. We generated double-digit revenue growth across the App Store, Apple Music, cloud services, AppleCare, Apple Pay and our App Store search ad business. And we set all-time Services revenue records in four of our five geographic segments. We are very happy with this performance. As you can see from our new disclosures, Services accounted for 20% of our March quarter revenue and about one-third of our gross profit dollars.',\n",
       "    'Customer engagement in our ecosystem continues to grow. The number of transacting accounts on our digital content stores reached another new all-time high during the quarter with the number of paid accounts also setting a new all-time record and growing by strong double digits over last year. And we now have over 390 million paid subscriptions across our Services portfolio, an increase of 120 million versus just 12 months ago. All subscription categories are growing strong double digits, and as we mentioned a quarter ago, we expect the number of paid subscriptions to surpass 0.5 billion during 2020. On the App Store, our subscription business is extremely diversified and is growing strongly around the world. In fact, the number of paid third-party subscriptions increased by over 40% compared to last year in each of our geographic segments. And across all third-party subscription apps, the largest accounted for only 0.3% of our total Services revenue.',\n",
       "    \"Next I'd like to talk about the Mac. Revenue was $5.5 billion compared to $5.8 billion a year ago, with the decline driven primarily by processor constraints on certain popular models. In spite of this challenge, we generated double-digit Mac revenue growth in Japan and Korea, setting new all-time Mac revenue records in both markets. On a global basis, nearly half of the customers purchasing Macs during the quarter were new to Mac. And the active installed base of Macs reached a new all-time high.\",\n",
       "    'We had great results for iPad, reached $4.9 billion in revenue and growth accelerating from the December quarter to 22%. iPad revenue grew in all five of our geographic segments with a return to growth in Greater China and strong double-digit growth in all other segments. We had our best March quarter ever for iPad in Japan and we were especially pleased by performance in Korea, Thailand and Mexico where revenue more than doubled over last year. In total, over half of the customers purchasing iPads during the March quarter were new to iPad and the iPad active installed base also reached a new all-time high. iPad revenue growth has been fueled primarily by the great customer response to our new iPad Pro. This completely redesigned iPads with full screen liquid retina displays, Face ID, powerful A12X Bionic shape with neural engine and support for the new Apple Pencil and smart keyboard make iPad Pro the perfect PC laptop replacement for both consumers and professionals. The most recent surveys from 451 Research measured a 93% customer satisfaction rating for iPad overall. Among customers who plan to purchase tablets, 77% of consumers and 75% of businesses plan to purchase iPads.',\n",
       "    \"Wearables, home and accessories revenue set a new March quarter revenue record of $5.1 billion, fueled primarily by the strong performance of our wearables business, which grew close to 50%. Within this category Apple Watch is the best-selling and most loved smart watch in the world and produces best results ever for a non-holiday quarter. It's reaching many new customers with three-quarters of purchases going to customers who have never owned an Apple Watch before. Interest in AirPods has been off the charts and we're working hard to catch up with incredible customer demand.\",\n",
       "    \"Turning to our retail and online stores, we generated very strong double-digit revenue growth from Apple Watch and iPad. We also announced 50 new Today at Apple sessions during the quarter in three new and expanded formats; Skills, Walks and Labs, free at our stores around the world. We are making important progress in the enterprise market, helping transform major industries. We're building on Apple's leading position in key functional areas to expand our reach and share within large accounts. Aviation is a strong example of the strategy at work. Across 450 airlines, iPad is overwhelmingly the preferred solutions for the pilots' electronic flight bag. We've been making great progress expanding the Apple's footprint beyond the cockpit into the cabin. We are more than half of the top 50 airlines have now implemented iOS to enhance the guest experience, as well as enable a new use case with mobile point of sale. We are also seeing traction with other mission critical airline functions in ground operations and flight maintenance. For example, one of the largest airlines in the world tells us that the adoption of iPad has kept maintenance delays in half. Apple services are also making their way on board including growing adoption of Apple Pay for food and beverage purchases and in-flight access to Apple Music.\",\n",
       "    \"We're also seeing significant iOS traction with large enterprise platforms, which are the face of complex backend systems to tens of millions of employees around the world. The end user employee experience is vital to engagement and productivity and with the increase in mobility of today's modern workforce, those experiences are best on native iOS applications. We see great momentum through the growing number of iOS SDKs being delivered by the world's largest enterprise platforms. For instance, SAP's SDK for iOS continues to gain strong traction with their customers growing by more than 40% in the last six months. And this past quarter, Salesforce released its SDK enabling developers to build native iOS applications directly on top of the Salesforce platform. And finally, our enterprise channels continue to build momentum. In February, our Apple at Work initiative was launched with AT&T. This extension to our ongoing collaboration with AT&T will make it easy for more customers to choose the best Apple products for their needs in the enterprise and modernize their business. AT&T will enable business services for Apple products to companies with their IT strategy, including device management, security, productivity and collaboration.\",\n",
       "    \"Let me now turn to our cash position. We ended the quarter with $225 billion in cash plus marketable securities. We also had $101 billion in term debt and $12 billion in commercial paper outstanding, for a net cash position of almost $113 billion. As a result, we are in a very strong position that allows us to invest confidently in all areas of the business, while continuing to return value to our shareholders. Just last year, we announced a commitment to contribute more than $350 billion to the US economy over the next five years, including the creation of 20,000 jobs. More recently, we've announced a major expansion in Austin, Texas and in other cities across the country. All these efforts are essential investments to make sure that we're incorporating innovative ideas and top talent wherever they emerge. As we execute those initiatives, we are also able to return over $27 billion to investors during the March quarter. We began a $12 billion accelerated share repurchase program in February, resulting in the initial delivery and retirement of 55.1 million shares. We also repurchased 71.7 million Apple shares for $12 billion through open market transactions and we paid $3.4 billion in dividends and equivalents.\",\n",
       "    \"Our priorities for cash have not changed over the years. Most importantly, we always want to maintain the cash we need to run our business, maintain strategic flexibility and invest in our future. We are well on our way toward meeting the investment projections we laid out early last year. We also want to work toward a more optimal capital structure, and as we said before, it is our plan to reach a net cash neutral position over time. Given our confidence in Apple's future and the value we see in our stock, our Board has authorized an additional $75 billion for share repurchases, and because we know many of our investors value income, we are also raising our quarterly dividend for the seventh time in less than seven years to $0.77, an increase of about 5% from the previous amount. We paid over $14 billion in dividends and equivalents over the last four quarters alone, making us one of the largest dividend payers in the world. Going forward, we continue to plan for annual increases in dividends per share.\",\n",
       "    \"As we move ahead into the June quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call. We expect revenue to be between $52.5 and $54.5 billion. This guidance range comprehends 300 basis points of negative foreign exchange impact year-over-year. Also as a reminder, in the June quarter last year, our Services revenue included a favorable $236 million one-time item in connection with the final resolution of various lawsuits. We expect gross margin to be between 37% and 38%. We expect OpEx to be between $8.7 billion and $8.8 billion. We expect OI&E to be about $250 million and we expect the tax rate to be about 16.5%.\",\n",
       "    'Also reflecting the approved increase, today our Board of Directors has declared the cash dividend of $0.77 per share of common stock payable on May 16, 2019, to shareholders of record as of May 15, 2019.',\n",
       "    \"With that, I'd like to open the call to questions.\",\n",
       "    'Questions and Answers:',\n",
       "    'Thank you, Luca. And we ask that you limit yourselves to two questions. Operator, may we have first question please?',\n",
       "    'Certainly. Our first question will come from Shannon Cross with Cross Research.',\n",
       "    \"Thank you very much for taking my question. Tim, can you talk a bit more about what you're seeing in China? Clearly, it looks like things are improving sequentially. You also mentioned that last few weeks of the quarter we're stabilizing in emerging markets, I believe. So, what are our customers saying there and what are your partners saying in China? And then I have a follow-up.\",\n",
       "    \"Yes. Thank you, Shannon. And we are glad to put the litigation behind us and all the litigation around the world has been dismissed and it's settled. We are very happy to have a multi-year supply agreement and we are happy that we have a direct license arrangement with Qualcomm, which was I know important for both companies. And so we feel good about the resolution.\",\n",
       "    'Thank you, Shannon. Can we have the next question please?',\n",
       "    'The next question will come from Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan.',\n",
       "    \"Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Tim, you talked about China responding well to the pricing actions that you've taken in that market. Do any of those learnings kind of carried through into how you decide pricing in the remaining emerging markets, like India, et cetera, as you get ready for the next product cycle?\",\n",
       "    \"We have made some adjustments in India, and we've seen preliminarily some better results there. Everything that we do does advise everything we do in the future. So we tried to learn the best we can and fold that into our thinking and we will obviously do that with this as well.\",\n",
       "    \"Thank you. I just had a quick follow-up for Luca on the Services side. Luca, we see that you are guiding to higher operating expenses quarter-on-quarter. How much of that incremental is going in to support the new services that you're planning to launch later in the year?\",\n",
       "    \"Yes. Of course, we are supporting both our products and services business, and you can see the trajectory of our OpEx over the different quarters. Clearly, as we add new services, we will need to make the necessary investments to support them. Our Services business has multiple streams. In total, it is accretive to company gross margins; you've seen the latest we running Services margins at over 60%. So it's a very important business for us in many ways, for our ecosystem and for our ability to monetize it and so clearly we will make all the necessary investments to ensure that the new services are successful and we're really encouraged by the level of customer response that we've received so far in anticipation for the launch of these services.\",\n",
       "    'Thank you, Samik. Can we have the next question please?',\n",
       "    'The next question will come from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley.',\n",
       "    \"Thank you. Luca, if I look back over the past five years, June quarter revenue typically declines about 15% from the March quarter. You're guiding to an 8% drop this year. So can you just talk about which regions or product segment you think can outperform that typical seasonality?\",\n",
       "    \"Yes, Katy, and keep in mind, by the way, we are reporting this guidance including a 300 basis point negative impact from foreign exchange. So actually, in constant currency, the numbers would be even stronger. At the product category level, we expect that we will continue to have strong revenue growth from the non-iPhone categories, as we've had for the first half of our fiscal year. We are also expecting a relative improvement in our iPhone performance on a year-over-year basis in Q3 versus the first half. As Tim said, March was the strongest month of the quarter on a year-over-year basis and so this has given the confidence to provide the guidance that you've seen. Geographically, of course, as you've seen from our results for the March quarter, China is the geo where we found some challenges, but we believe the trajectory should improve over time.\",\n",
       "    \"Thank you. And then just as a follow-up. As Shannon said, you're not going to talk specifics around the timing of the 5G phone, but Tim, maybe you can talk about how the company approaches a new technology like this, given the higher cost but also potentially significant benefit? How you think about the right timing for coming to market with a product with those characteristics? And then just generally how meaningful you think 5G is as a demand driver for upgrades in your iPhone installed base? Thank you.\",\n",
       "    'Thank you, Katy. Could we have the next question please?',\n",
       "    'Jim Suva from Citi has our next question.',\n",
       "    \"Thank you very much. A topic that's probably split or shared by both Tim and Luca on a response, but I'll ask the question and you can decide how to divide it up. In your opening remarks, Tim, you mentioned about pricing adjustments that you made in some of the markets and then Luca talked also about the strength of the trade-in program or maybe was Tim also. Can you help us understand about what type of lessons or elasticity you've learned about pricing and the trade-in programs of how it impacts like revenues and COGS and margins and things? Thank you.\",\n",
       "    \"The other two items that are not insignificant in China that I don't want to lose here is that the stimulus programs, I believe, are having an effect on the consumer. The one that got the most visibility and that happened in early April was the VAT reduction from 16% to 13%. So it's a very aggressive move, but there are other stimulus programs as well that likely have an effect at the consumer level. And then finally, and this is not to be under weighted either, I think the improved trade dialog between the countries effects consumer confidence in a positive way. And so I think it's sort of the sum of all of those things.\",\n",
       "    \"And Jim, if I may add on the gross margin level, as we look at pricing actions, of course, anytime you do a pricing action, it is gross margin percentage diluted, but what really matters to us and what we look at when we look at the elasticity of these programs is, to see the impact on our gross margin dollars and what the experience that we've had in a few of these emerging markets has been positive in that respect. And so that's what we think matters the most really.\",\n",

       "    'The next question will come from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.',\n",
       "    \"Hi, yes. Thank you. Tim, you shared a lot of color around trade-ins, but I was also hoping maybe you can characterize what sort of dynamics you're seeing across your installed base on these trade-ins, what type of devices are being traded in, is the profile of someone who has a really old iPhone or are you seeing, folks that have newer iPhones trading in and what sort of incentives are you providing beyond sort of the financing to drive that? And do you see this as something that can accelerate replacement cycles here over the next year or so? And I have a follow-up.\",\n",
       "    'Thanks for the color, Tim. And as my follow-up, Luca, can you just clarify if the settlement with Qualcomm is creating either a headwind or a tailwind to your gross margins in the near term, and does your guidance contemplate incremental pricing actions that could be creating some gross margin headwinds? Thank you.',\n",
       "    \"As Tim has explained, we've reached this a comprehensive agreement with Qualcomm. As part of this, we have agreed that we're not going to share the financial terms of the agreements, so we plan to honor that. What you see in our gross margin guidance for the June quarter, we guided 37% to 38% fully comprehends the outcome of the agreement with Qualcomm.\",\n",

       "    \"Thanks for taking my questions. So you have more than 1.4 billion active devices at your event you announced services that leverage that installed base and you have obviously a remarkable position with kind of this Trojan horse of devices out in so many households. So I guess the question is, and I know some of these services aren't even live yet, but should we expect a continuation of the building out of new services categories, like what we saw at the March event, is there a pipeline of new services in the works or have we kind of seen what we're likely to see on that front for the near to intermediate term? And then I have a follow?\",\n",
       "    \"Right. And then you mentioned the App Store search ad business a couple of times in the prepared remarks. Is that reaching a point where it's become material and maybe moving the needle for overall Services revenue or is there anything you can quantify related to that? I also imagine that this is a high margin business, at least maybe higher than the overall Services margin, but wondering if you can confirm if that's the case or not. Thanks.\",\n",

Tim, when you look at the four things that you have announced and I realize they have different dates when they're coming out but, which ones would you say over the next 12 months has the most potential to help your Services line? And then maybe, which one has the best long-term potential? And then, I have a quick follow-up.\",\n",
       "    \"I think India is a very important market in the long-term. It's a challenging market in the short-term, but we're learning a lot. We have started manufacturing there, which is very important to be able to serve the market in a reasonable way. And we're growing that capability there. And we would like to place retail stores there. And we're working with the government to seek approval to do that. And so, we plan on going in there with sort of all of our might. We've opened a developer, accelerator there, which we're very happy with some of the things coming out of there. It's a long-term play. It's not something that's going to be on overnight huge business. But I think the growth potential is phenomenal. It doesn't bother me that it's primarily an Android business at the moment because that just means there's a lot of opportunity there.\",\n",

Today's call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Nancy Paxton, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\",\n",
       "    \"Thank you. Good afternoon. And thanks to everyone for joining us. Speaking first today is Apple CEO, Tim Cook. And he'll be followed by CFO, Luca Maestri. And after that, we'll open the call to questions from analysts. Please note that some of the information you'll hear during our discussion today will consist of forward-looking statements including, without limitation, those regarding revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, other income and expense, taxes, capital allocation, and future business outlook. Actual results or trends could differ materially from our forecast.\",\n",

Apple assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements or information which speak as of their respective dates. I'd now like to turn the call over to Tim for introductory remarks.\",\n",
       "    \"Thank you, Nancy. And thanks to everyone for joining us today. This isn't the first time you've heard from us regarding the December quarter. So, the first thing I want to do is provide some final results and connect those back to the letter we shared at the beginning of the month. As you know, our December quarter revenue was below our original expectations, coming in at $84.3 billion. That's down 5% from a year ago or down 3%, adjusting for foreign exchange. We noted four factors that would impact our results when we provided guidance in November: different iPhone launch timing from a year ago, FX headwinds, supply constraints on certain products, and macroeconomic conditions in emerging markets. One of those factors, weak macro conditions in some emerging markets was significantly more severe than we originally foresaw, especially in Greater China. As our letter noted, that challenge was compounded by quarterly iPhone upgrades that were lower than we anticipated.\",\n",
       "    \"We'll return to upgrades in a moment. But I first wanna say a bit more about our business in Greater China. Our revenue there was down by $4.8 billion from last year with declines across iPhone, Mac, and iPad. Most of the shortfall relative to our original guidance and over 100% of our worldwide year-over-year revenue decline was driven by performance in greater China. Despite iPhone upgrades being lower than we anticipated, our business grew outside of China, including new records in the Americas, western Europe, central and eastern Europe, and our rest of Asia-Pacific segment. We had record performance in large markets, including the United States, Canada, Mexico, Germany, Italy, Spain, and Korea. In the letter we shared earlier this month, we said we were proud to participate in the Chinese marketplace and that we believe our business has a bright future there over time. But I think some of that got lost. So, I wanna share a bit more detail on the positives we see in China.\",\n",
       "    \"We generated record December quarter services revenue in Greater China fueled by an amazing ecosystem with over two and a half million registered iOS developers. We saw very strong results from our wearables business there with revenues up over 50%. We also continued to grow our total active installed base by adding new customers. In fact, more than two-thirds of all customers in China who bought a Mac or an iPad during the December quarter were purchasing that product for the first time. Finally, for perspective, despite the challenging December quarter, our revenue from China grew slightly for the full calendar year. Macroeconomic factors will come and go. But we see great upside in continuing to focus on the things that we can control. Returning to iPhone, I'd like to talk about our results in the context of those lower than expected upgrades. iPhone XR, iPhone XS, and iPhone XS Max are by far the best iPhones we've ever shipped.\",\n",
       "    \"They share advanced technologies, including the A12 Bionic, the most powerful chip ever in a smartphone with our next-generation neural engine capable of five trillion operations per second. These are also completely modern iPhones with stunning large, full-screen displays and face ID, the most secure authentication of any kind available in a smartphone. And the cameras are simply amazing with portrait mode and depth control to allow users to create studio-quality photos as well as stunning 4k video, opening a whole new era of photography. We couldn't be more proud of our iPhone lineup and our industry-leading customer satisfaction. We wouldn't change our position for anyone. Now, our customers are holding onto their older iPhones a bit longer than in the past. When you pair this with the macroeconomic factors, particularly in emerging markets, it resulted in I Phone revenue that was down 15% from last year.\",\n",
       "    \"Our iPhone results accounted for significantly more than our entire year-over-year revenue decline. In fact, outside of iPhone, our business grew strongly, by 19%. So, what's behind this? It's important to understand what's going on from the customer perspective at the point of purchase. We believe it is the sum of several factors. First, foreign exchange. The relative strength of the US dollar has made our products more expensive many parts of the world. In Turkey, for example, the leer depreciated by 33% over the course of calendar 2018. And in the December quarter, our revenue there was down by almost $700 million from the previous year. Second, subsidies. For various reasons, iPhone subsidies are becoming increasingly less common. In Japan, for example, iPhone purchases were traditionally subsidized by carriers and bundled with service contracts. Competitive promotional activity frequently increased the amount of subsidy during key periods.\",\n",
       "    \"Today, local regulations have significantly restricted those subsidies as well as related competition. As a result, we estimate that less than half of iPhones sold in Japan in 1 of this year were subsidized compared to about three quarters a year ago and that the total value of those subsidies have come down as well. Third, our battery replacement program. For millions of customers, we made it inexpensive and efficient to replace the battery and hold onto their existing iPhones some people have suggested that we shouldn't have done this because of the potential impact on upgrades. But we strongly believe it was the right thing to do for our customers. What's very important, however, is that in spite of these factors, our total active installed base of devices has grown from 1.3 billion at the end of January of 2018 to 1.4 billion by the end of December reaching a new all-time high for each of the many product categories and for all five of our geographic segments.\",\n",
       "    \"Not only is our large and growing install base a powerful testament to the satisfaction and loyalty of our customers, but it's also fueling our fast-growing services business. In fact, services revenue set an all-time record of $10.9 billion in the December quarter, growing 19%. We not only generated our highest local services revenue ever. But we also had all-time records across multiple categories of services, including the app store, Apple Play, Cloud Services, and our app store search ad business. And we had a December quarter record for Apple Care. And I'm very proud to say that nearly 16 years after launching the iTunes store, we generated our highest quarterly music revenue ever thanks to the great popularity of Apple Music now with over 50 million paid subscribers. The app store wrapped up its best year ever with record holiday period results propelled by the biggest Christmas day and Christmas week ever.\",\n",
       "    \"Customers also spent over $322 million on New Year's Day, alone, setting a new single-day record for both the number of customers and purchase volume. It was also a great holiday season for Apple Pay with over 1.8 billion transactions in the quarter well over twice the volume of the year-ago quarter. Merchant adoption continues to reach new milestones. Customers can now use Apple Pay with iPhone and Apple Watch at nearly 3000 speedway locations while all Target, Taco Bell, and Jack stores will be accepting Apple Pay soon. We launched Apple Pay in three new countries in the December quarter: Germany, Belgium, and Kazakhstan. And it's now live in 27 markets around the world. The rollout in Germany has been a huge success with Deutsche Bank reporting more activations for Apple Pay in one week than for Android in an entire year. This is yet another example of what's possible when you bring together Apple's world-class hardware, software, and ecosystem with our engaged and active user base.\",\n",
       "    \"Shoppers around the world love Apple Pay. And it has increasingly become an indispensable part of daily life. Revenue from cloud services continues to grow rapidly with year-over-year revenue up over 40% in the December quarter. And readership ofApple Newsset a new record with over 85 million monthly active users in the three countries where we've launched, the United States, the UK, and Australia. Here in the US, the latest data from COMM scores shows thatApple Newshas the largest audience of all news apps. And the international audience will continue to grow with our first ever bilingual launch in Canada, available to customers later this quarter. In summary, we are very happy not only with the growth but also the breadth of our services portfolio. Our revenue from services has grown from less than $8 billion in calendar 2010 to over $41 billion in calendar 2018. The largest category represents less than 30% of total services revenue.\",\n",
       "    \"And the new services we've launched in the last few years are all experiencing tremendous growth. We had our best quarter ever from Mac revenue which was up 9%, fueled by our new MacBook Air and Mac mini, introduced in October. The MacBook Air includes a beautiful new retina display, touch ID, and forced touch trackpad while the new Mac mini provides a powerful, flexible solution for everything from home automation to giant render forms. iPad revenue was up 17%, its highest growth rate in almost six years, powered by the new iPad Pro, released in November. With its edge to edge liquid retina display, face ID, and A12X bionic chip, the new iPad Pro has been described by reviewers as a tablet with no equal and the most powerful mobile device ever made. We also had our best quarter ever for wearables, home, and accessories with 33% growth in total and almost 50% growth from wearables thanks to strong sales above Apple Watch and AirPods.\",\n",
       "    \"We don't measure our success in 90-day increments. We manage Apple for the long-term. And when we consider the keys to our success over time, there are three that stand out: our highly satisfied and loyal customers, our large and growing active installed base, and, at the heart of it all, our deeply ingrained culture of innovation. Thanks to all this, our ecosystem is stronger than ever before. We have an amazingly talented team creating hardware, software, and services, optimizing each of them to create an unparalleled user experience. Apple Watch is a powerful example of that. It's humbling to read emails from customers around the world telling us how Apple Watch has dramatically changed their lives by motivating them to be more fit and active, by alerting them to potentially serious health conditions, such as AFib, and by helping them in times of crisis with features like fall detection and emergency SOS.\",\n",
       "    \"We believe we are just beginning to see the impact we can make to improving health and are deeply inspired by the possibilities. Another example is the work we're doing with Silicone. We've embedded machine learning directly into the Silicon with our A12 Bionic chip. Our custom neural engine not only provides power efficiency and incredible performance in a very small package, but it also enables processing of data and transactions directly on the device. This means iPhone can recognize patterns, make predictions, and learn from experience. And it does all this while keeping personal information private. This is a powerful example of how innovation and privacy can go hand in hand at a time when these issues are increasingly important to our users. We are undertaking and accelerating a number of initiatives to improve our results. It's not in our DNA to just stand around and wait for macroeconomic conditions to improve.\",\n",
       "    \"One such initiative is making it simple to trade in an iPhone in our stores and raising awareness of this opportunity. Because of the quality and durability of iPhones, they maintain significant residual value, making trade-ins a great opportunity. It's not only great for the environment. It's great for the customer as their existing phone acts as a subsidy for their new phone. And it's great for developers as a phone that is traded in and redistributed can help grow our active install base. Beginning last week, we started making it easier for people to pay for their phones over time with installment payments. And we're working on rolling out this program to more geographies as soon as we can. We are as confident as ever in the fundamental strength of our business. And we have a very strong pipeline of products and services with some exciting announcements coming later this year. Apple innovates like no other company on earth. And we are not taking our foot off the gas.\",\n",
       "    \"We'll continue to invest through near-term headwinds, just as we always have. And we'll emerge stronger as a result. Now, for more details on our December quarter results, I'd like to turn the call over to Luca.\",\n",
       "    \"Thank you, Tim. Good afternoon, everyone. As Tim said, revenue for the December quarter was $84.3 billion. This result was below our expectations. But we were able to set new all-time revenue records in the US, Canada, Latin America, western Europe, center and eastern Europe, and Korea. Our results were especially strong in the US where revenue was up by more than $1.5 billion compared to a year ago and in several markets where revenue grew by double digits, including, among others, Germany, Spain, Poland, Mexico, Malaysia, and Vietnam. Looking at proto categories, iPhone revenue declined 15% from a year ago where revenue from the rest of our business grew 19% to an all-time record, including our best results ever for services, for wearables, and for Mac. Company gross margin was 38%. This quarter, for the first time, we're making an important new disclosure to our investors as we believe it will foster a better understanding of our business.\",\n",
       "    'We are now reporting on a quarterly basis gross margin for products in aggregate and for services in aggregate. Product gross margin was 34.3%. And services gross margin was 62.8%. On a sequential basis, product gross margin increased 60 basis points due to positive leverage from the holiday quarter partially offset by higher cost structures as we launched several new products and by headwinds from foreign exchange. Services gross margin also increased 170 basis points, sequentially due to favorable mix and leverage, partially offset by foreign exchange. While both products and services gross margins improved sequentially, total company gross margin was down 30 basis points due to a different mix between products and services. Net income was $20 billion, about flat to last year. And diluted earnings per share were an all-time record of $4.18, an increase of 7.5% over last year. Operating cash flow was also very strong of $26.7 billion.',\n",
       "    \"Let me provide more color for the various products' categories. iPhone revenue was $52 billion. On a geographic basis, most of the decline from last year came from Greater China and other emerging markets with difficult macro and foreign exchange conditions affected our results. We also believe that the reduction of carrier subsidies and our battery replacement program had an impact in a number of countries around the world. And as Tim mentioned, we had a lower number of upgrades than we had anticipated at the beginning of the quarter. However, our global acting install base of iPhones continues to grow and has reached an all-time high at the end of December. We are disclosing that number now for the first time. And that surpassed 900 million devices, up year-over-year in each of our five geographic segments and growing almost 75 million in the last 12 months alone. We plan to provide information on the iPhone install base as well as total install base on a periodic basis.\",\n",
       "    'Customer satisfaction and loyalty for iPhone continue to be outstanding and are the highest in the industry. The latest survey of US consumers from 451 Research indicates customer satisfaction of 99% for iPhone XR, XS, and 1XS Max combined. And among business buyers who plan to purchase more phones in the March quarter, 81% plan to purchase iPhones. Based on the latest information from Kantar, iPhone experienced a 90% customer loyalty rating for iPhone customers in the US 23 points above the next highest brand measured. Turning to services, it was our best quarter ever with revenue of $10.9 billion, up 19% year-over-year with new December quarter records in all five of our geographic segments. Many services categories set new all-time revenue records all-time high during the quarter with the number of paid accounts growing by strong double-digits over last year. And we now have over 360 million paid subscriptions across our services.',\n",
       "    \"Our 2020 goal remains unchanged. And it excludes the impact of the revenue reclassification between products and services we recorded in connection with ASC 606, the new revenue recognition accounting standard that we adopted at the beginning of fiscal '19. The level of engagement of our customers in our ecosystem continues to grow. The number of transacting accounts on our digital stores reached a new all-time high during the quarter with the number of paid accounts growing by strong double-digits over last year. And we now have over 360 million paid subscriptions across our services portfolio, an increase of 120 million versus a year ago. Given the continued strength and momentum in this part of the business, we now expect the number of paid subscriptions to surpass half a billion during 2020. Our subscription business has become very large and diversified, covering many different categories from entertainment to health and fitness to lifestyle.\",\n",
       "    \"In fact, more than 30,000 third-party subscription apps are available today on the app store. And the largest of them accounts for only 0.3% of our total services revenue. Next, I'd like to talk about the Mac. We saw a great response to the new MacBook Air and Mac mini that we introduced in October which helped drive a 9% increase in Mac revenue over last year to a new all-time record. Mac revenue was up in the vast majority of countries we track with double-digit growth in many large markets such as the US, western Europe, center and eastern Europe, Japan, Korea, and South Asia. Our acting install base of Macs reached a new all-time high. And half of all the customers purchasing Macs in the December quarter were new to Mac. We also had great results for iPad with revenue up 17% from a year ago and strong performance of both iPad and iPad Pro and generated double-digit growth in four of our five geographic segments. Similar to the Mac, our install base of iPads reached a new all-time high.\",\n",
       "    'And among customers purchasing iPads during the quarter, half were new to iPad. The most recent consumer survey from 451 Research measured a 94% customer satisfaction rating for iPad overall with iPad Pro models scoring as high as 100%. Among business customers who plan to purchase tablets in the March quarter, 68% plan to purchase iPads. Wearables home and accessories revenue grew 33% to a new all-time record in each of our geographic segments. Revenue from this category was up over $1.8 billion compared to a year ago thanks to the amazing popularity of Apple Watch and AirPods, both of which were supply constrained as we exited the quarter. Based on revenue over the past four quarters, our wearables business is approaching the size of a Fortune 200 company. Our retail and online stores generated strong results from Mac and iPad and all-time record performance from services and from wearables.',\n",
       "    \"Following the launch of the new iPhone trade-in campaign, our stores more than doubled the volume of iPhones traded in compared to last year, reaching an all-time high in Q1. We added Thailand to our footprint with a beautiful store in Bangkok. And we opened a stunning new store on Champs-Élysées in Paris, exiting the quarter with 506 physical stores in 22 countries. In enterprise, across multiple industries, our technology continues to enable businesses to do their best work. In healthcare, iPhones and iOS apps continue to streamline and support clinical workflows, communications, and care delivery across leading health systems including Johns Hopkins Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Stanford Healthcare, and St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. In manufacturing, SKF, the world's largest producers of bearings and seals has transformed their manufacturing processes on iOS and iPhone with incredible success.\",\n",
       "    \"With custom iOS apps available to production operators across the worldwide locations, SKF has reduced production errors from 20% to 0% while saving 70% in system-related time. Apple technology has made possible a simplified user experience, integrating the SAP Cloud platform, yielding better accuracy, efficiency, and employee experiences across the board. We're also seeing great innovation in the construction industry with iPad and new third-party apps made for iOS. For instance, Procore Technologies has introduced an app to help decrease building errors on the job site. By using metal in split view with the iPad camera, construction workers can compare building plans and 3D models to what is actually being built in real time. This new iOS app reduces wasted raw materials and helps keep building projects on time and on budget. Let me now turn to our cash position. We ended the quarter with $245 billion in cash plus marketable securities.\",\n",
       "    \"We also had $102.8 billion in term debt and $12 billion in commercial paper outstanding for a net cash position of $130 billion. As we explained in the past, it is our plan to reach a net cash neutral position over time. As part of this plan, we returned over $13 billion to our investors during the December quarter. We repurchased 38 million Apple shares for $8.2 billion through open market transactions. And we paid $3.6 billion in dividends and equivalents. Consistent with our historical cadence, we plan to provide an update on our overall capital return program when we report our March quarter results. As we move ahead into the March quarter, I'd like to review our outlook which reviews the types of forward-looking information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call.\",\n",
       "    \"We expect revenue to be between $55 and $59 billion. This range reflects a negative year-over-year impact of $1.3 billion from foreign exchange which represents about 210 basis points of last year's revenue and a more uncertain macroeconomic environment than a year ago, especially in emerging markets. We expect gross margin to be between 37% and 38%. On a sequential basis, this range reflects seasonal loss of leverage and 60 basis points of favorable impact from foreign exchange partially offset by commodity cost savings. We expect OpEx to be between $8.5 and $8.6 billion. We expect OINE to be about $300 million. And we expect the tax rate to be about 17%. Also, today, our board of directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.73 per share of common stock, payable on February 14, 2019 to shareholders of record as of February 11, 2019. With that, I'd like to open the call to questions.\",\n",
       "    'Thank you, Luca. And we ask that you limit yourselves to two questions. And may we have the first question, please?',\n",
       "    'Questions and Answers:',\n",
       "    'Certainly. Our first question will come from Katie Huberty with Morgan Stanley.',\n",
       "    'Thank you. Good afternoon. Services growth did decelerate from the growth rates in recent quarters. So, can you talk about the factors that played into that slower growth? And then appreciate the new disclosure around paid subscribers. But if you compare what you added in 2018 versus what you expect to add over the next two years, that implies a slowdown in annual net new subscribers. So, should we be thinking about services as a lower growth segment than what you experienced in 2018? And then I have a follow-up.',\n",
       "    \"Yes, Katie. Let me take that one. First of all, when we talk about the services business, it's very important to start from the momentum that we have. As you know, we have set an ambitious target for ourselves to double the size of our business from fiscal '16 to 2020 which implied at the time a 19% CAGR. So far, we've been able to grow above 20%. In fiscal '18, we grew 22%. So, we are on track to achieve our objective. And it's important to understand what is driving the growth of the business. First of all, it's our install base. As we just told you, the install base continues to grow very nicely. It has reached 1.4 billion active devices at the end of December. And really, very little of our services revenue is driven by what we sold in the last 90 days. The second factor for the growth of the services business is that within this installed base, the percentage of users who are paying for at least one service is growing very strongly. This is due to several factors.\",\n",
       "    \"But I think you've seen over recent quarters that we've been adding about 120 million on a year-over-year basis for a number of quarters now. And this is an incredible, staggering number when you think about it. We're also broadening the scope of many of these services. If you take Apple Pay as an example, it started off as the most convenient, most private, and most secure way to make a payment in a store or in an app. Then we took Apple Pay to Safari. Then we started a peer-to-peer service. And we're launching it in new markets across the world every quarter. So, we are broadening that scope. And of course, similar to what we've done in the past, in the last three years, we launched several new services. We're also looking to launch new services going forward that we believe will provide great value to our users. And we're really very excited about the opportunities that we see in front of us. I think you're referring to the deceleration in the growth rate that we've seen in the December quarter.\",\n",
       "    'So, that explains about a third of that deceleration. There are, I would say, three factors that explain this difference between the 24.5% to the 19%. The first one is that foreign exchange plays a role. Roughly 60% of our services business is outside the United States. And as you know, the US dollar has appreciated in recent months. And in general, we tend not to reprise our services for foreign exchange on a very frequent basis. The second factor is a well-known issue around the app store in China. The app store in China is a large business for us. We believe this issue around the approval of new-gain titles is temporary in nature but clearly is affecting our business right now.',\n",
       "    \"And then thirdly, we have seen some level of deceleration in Apple Care which has had very, very strong growth during fiscal '18 where we're starting to lap some of the increase in distribution coverage that we put in place recently and the channel field of Apple components that happened when we increased the distribution coverage. But in general, we're very, very pleased with 90% growth. And we think that the business will continue to grow nicely going forward.\",\n",
       "    'Thank you for that color. Just a quick follow-up, Luca. Share repurchases in the December quarter were well below the run rate from the June and September quarters. How much did the weaker quarter play into your ability to carry out the buyback at the same level? And what should we think about as the right run rate going forward?',\n",
       "    \"Well, we've always said that we're very committed to executing our program. We have done almost $150 billion of repurchases from the beginning of the program. But we've also said that we want to execute the program in an efficient, effective, I would say disciplined manner. And that takes into account also overall market conditions. So, that's what we did during the course of the December quarter. Our fundamental view remains the same. We are optimistic about our future. And we think there is great value in our stock. And so, we will continue to execute the program. We will continue to report at the end of every quarter. And by the way, when we report our March quarter results, we will also talk about the next step in our category return program which is something that we do traditionally in the spring.\",\n",
       "    'Thank you, Katie. Can we have the next question, please?',\n",
       "    'The next question will come from',\n",
       "    'Great. Thank you very much. Some had the perception that you priced the new iPhones too high. What have you learned about price elasticity? And do you feel that perhaps you pushed the envelope a little bit too far and might have to bring that down in the future?',\n",
       "    \"Steve, it's Tim. If you look at what we did this past year, we priced the iPhone XS in the US the same as we had priced the iPhone X a year ago. The iPhone XS Max which was new was $100.00 more than the XS. And then we priced the XR right in the middle of where the entry iPhone 8 and entry iPhone 8 Plus had been priced. So, there's actually a pretty small difference in the United States compared to last year. However, the foreign exchange issue that Luca spoke of in the call made that difference or amplified that difference in international markets. In particular, the emerging markets which tended to move much more significantly versus the dollar. And so, what we have done in January and in some locations in some products is essentially absorb part or all of the foreign currency move as compared to last year and therefore, get close or perhaps right on the local price from a year ago. So, yes. I do think that price is a factor.\",\n",
       "    \"I think part of it is that, the FX piece. And then secondly, in some markets, as I had talked about in my prepared remarks, the subsidy is probably the bigger of the issues in the developed markets. I had mentioned Japan. But also, even in this country, even though the subsidy has gone away for a period of time, if you're a customer that your last purchase was a 6S or a 6 or, in some cases even, a 7, you may have paid $199.00 for it. And now, in the unbundled world, it's obviously much more than that. And so, we are working through those. And we've got a number of actions to address that, including the trade-in and the installment payments which I had mentioned as well.\",\n",
       "    \"I know that you're not giving units going forward. But you said you might make qualitative comments. I was wondering if you have a comment, particularly on the ASP on a year-over-year basis.\",\n",
       "    \"Well, Steve, we did mention on the call last quarter that the different timing our phone launches would affect the year-over-year compares. If you remember, our top models, the XS and XS Max shipped during the September quarter which placed the channel fill and the initial sales in that quarter while last year, the iPhone X shipped in Q1 in the December quarter, placing the channel fill and initial sales in the December quarter. So, we knew that this would create a difficult compare for Q1 of '19. And this is essentially what happened. It was pretty much in line with our expectations. To give you more color, I would say that the XR is our most popular model. And it's followed by XS Max and then the XS.\",\n",
       "    'Thank you, Steve. Could we have the next question, please?',\n",
       "    'The next question will come from Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein.',\n",
       "    \"Yeah. Three questions there. The first one is a question around conservatism. As we always do, when we provide a range, it's a range that we believe we're gonna fall within. We've done pretty well with that up until the December quarter. We did amaze in years and years. So, that's the idea. There isn't that specific level of conservatism. We believe that this is the range where we're gonna fall within. On channel inventory, as you know, our historical pattern for iPhone channel inventory is that typically, we increase inventory in Q1, and we decrease in Q2. And we think this year will be similar. And we've exited the December quarter with levels of inventory that we are comfortable with. So, that leaves us with the reality that our iPhone performance in Q1 from a revenue standpoint was minus-15%.\",\n",
       "    \"And we expected the key factors that Tim mentioned during the call affecting iPhone performance in Q1 will also have an effect on Q2 starting with the strong US dollar environment. On a year-over-year basis, the negative impact from currency is gonna be about $1.3 billion. So, that's a bit more than two points versus last year's revenue. And so, that obviously plays a role. And the macroeconomic environment, particularly in emerging markets will continue to be there. On the positive side, we expect that we will continue to grow revenue nicely from the rest of the business which is not iPhone.\",\n",
       "    'Okay. Thank you. Tim, at your September event, Lisa Jackson, the Apple VP stated the company needed to, \"design products to last as long as possible.\" And Apple\\'s clearly doing that by helping with the battery replacement program, iOS working on an older range of products, etc. But the question is why doesn\\'t that mean that replacement or upgrade cycles for iPhones should continue to extend going forward? And in part, because that\\'s almost one of your objectives. And maybe to that end, maybe you can help us understand what iPhones\\' average replacement cycle might be today, and how that may have changed over the last three to five years. And again, why wouldn\\'t you expect it to elongate over time given some of the aforementioned things? Thank you.',\n",
       "    \"We do design our products to last as long as possible. Some people hold onto those for the life of the product. And some people trade them in. And then that phone is then redistributed to someone else. And so, it doesn't necessarily follow that one leads to the other. The upgrade cycle has extended. There's no doubt about that. We've said several times on this call and before that the upgrades for the quarter were less than we anticipated due to all the reasons that we had mentioned. So, where it goes in the future, I don't know. But I'm convinced that making a great product that is high quality is the best thing for the customer. And we work for the user. And so, that's the way that we look at it.\",\n",
       "    'Thank you, Toni. Could we have the next question, please?',\n",
       "    'Next question will come from Shannon Cross with Cross Research.',\n",
       "    \"Thank you very much. I wanted to ask about the trajectory of services gross margin, up about 500 basis points it appears year-over-year. You talked a little bit about sequential. But what's driving the improvement? Or will it be volatile as we go through the year depending on quarters and mix? Just whatever color you can give us as we start to forecast this. Thank you.\",\n",
       "    \"But you've seen that for the last 12 months, they've gone up nicely 450 basis points. And sequentially, they've gone up 170 basis points. But I wouldn't draw necessarily a conclusion on how these services gross margin is gonna move over time. We will report, of course, at the end of every quarter. But it's important to keep in mind it's a broad portfolio with very different gross margins profiles within the portfolio. It is important for us to grow gross margin dollars. And if, at times, we grow services that are at a level of gross margins which is below average, as long as this is good for the customer and as long as we generate gross margin dollars, we're gonna be very pleased.\",\n",
       "    \"Okay. Thank you. And then Tim, can you talk a bit about video? You've signed a myriad of deals. There was announcement about the TBF directly on Samsung. So, perhaps when this comes out, you'll be multiplatform. I'm just curious how you view the opportunity in video. And assuming you can just leverage the costs that you've made already, it should be accretive to margin, I would think.\",\n",
       "    \"We think that people are really gonna like that. Another way is, of course, all the third-party video subscriptions that are on the store. We're participating in this today. And I would guess that that's going to accelerate into the future as the bundle breaks down and people begin to buy likely multiple services in place of their current cable bundle. And then finally, original content. We will participate in the original content world. We have signed a multiyear partnership with Oprah. But today, I'm not really ready to extend that conversation beyond that point. We've hired some great people that I have a super amount of confidence in. And they're working really hard. And we'll have something to say more on that later.\",\n",
       "    'Thank you, Shannon. Could we have the next question, please?',\n",
       "    'The next question will come from Walter Piecyk with BTIG.',\n",
       "    \"Great. Thanks. I just have a question on the free services. Can you just describe how the math works on that? Is it that the free services are non-cash revenue that's getting booked in the services revenue at no cost, and then the costs come out of products? Can you just run us through what the current state is versus how you were accounting for that before?\",\n",
       "    \"Yeah. In essence, when we sell a product at a certain price, we make an assumption. We estimate the value that can be associated to providing free services. In our case, it's providing maps services, providing Siri, and providing free iCloud to all the customers that purchase our product.\",\n",
       "    \"And so, we calculate an estimated value. That value gets deferred and gets amortized over the estimated period of time that we deliver the free services. In the past, that deferral and the subsequent amortization was reported under products. Now, in connection with the new revenue recognition standard, we are reclassifying, essentially, that amortization from products revenue to services revenue. So, total revenue has not changed. We just report that estimated value under the services category. We also reclassify the cost that we need to incur to provide those services. So, the gross margin rate of these services is clearly significantly dilutive to the overall services margin. I hope I've helped with that.\",\n",
       "    \"Yeah. As I said, essentially, what we send services to is our install base. So, the first driver is growing the install base. And install base has grown nicely over the last several years. We've added 100 million in the last 12 months alone. So, that's the first step. Then within that install base, of course, we wanna make sure that there are more people that are so interested in our services that, in addition to transacting on those services on a free basis, they also are interested in paying for those services. And I mentioned that the percentage of paid accounts has increased strong double-digits. So, we want to continue to do that. We wanna make it easier for our customers to actually use our services. And so, we are accepting more and more payment methods around the world. And clearly, as you said, the idea of adding new services is very important to us. During the last three years, we've added Apple Pay which has been incredibly successful. And it's a wonderful customer experience.\",\n",

In addition to being a great time, it put an exclamation point at the end of a remarkable fiscal 2018. This year we shipped our 2 billion iOS device, celebrated the 10th anniversary of the App Store and achieved the strongest revenue and earnings in Apple's history.\",\n",
       "    \"In fiscal year '18 our revenue grew by $36.4 billion, that's the equivalent of a Fortune 100 company in a single year, and recapping all that all with our best September quarter ever. Revenue was $62.9 billion, ahead of our expectation. That's an increase of 20% over last year and our highest growth rate in three years. We also generated record Q4 earnings with 41% year-over-year growth in EPS. Record results from iPhone, Services and Wearables drove our momentum and we produced strong double-digit revenue growth in all of our geographic segment.\",\n",
       "    'It was a big year and a big quarter for iPhone. Q4 revenue was up 29% over last year, an increase of over $8 billion to a new September quarter record, fueled by continued momentum for iPhone 8, 8 Plus and 10 and the very successful launch of iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max.',\n",
       "    \"These latest devices are our most advanced iPhones ever, with the industry's first 7 nanometer A12 Bionic chip with an Apple design 8-core neural engine capable of executing an astounding five trillion operations per second. The A12 Bionic is many years in the making and a huge technological leap forward. It sets the iPhone experience far apart from the competition, using real-time machine learning to transform the way we experienced photos, gaming, augmented reality and more. It makes full use of the dual camera system that shoots portrait mode photos with smart HDR and dynamic depth of field and Face ID is even faster. The response has been powerful.\",\n",
       "    \"As one reviewer put it, iPhone XS and XS Max are the perfect blend of design and craftsmanship as well as seamlessly intuitive user experience. We're not done yet. Just last week, we began shipping iPhone XR, bringing the latest iPhone breakthroughs to even more users with an all-screen glass and aluminum design and the most advanced LCD in a smartphone, the product reviews have been overwhelmingly mainly positive.\",\n",
       "    \"iOS 12 has gotten off to an incredible start. It's been installed on more systems in its first month in any version of iOS ever. iOS 12 is delivering systemwide performance enhancements Siri Shortcuts and new tools to help people reduce interruptions and manage screen time for themselves and their kids. Siri shortcuts in particular is already deeply integrated with some of the most popular apps out there. Whether you're tracking your workouts or rushing to catch a flight, you can be sure, all of your most relevant apps are working together with Siri in the driver seat.\",\n",
       "    \"iOS 12 also features a ARKit 2, a major upgrade to our augmented reality engine. ARKit 2 makes possible simultaneous multi-user experiences and real world object incorporation. Our developer community is really running with this technology. From gaming to shopping, we're seeing great new use cases emerge. iOS devices delivered the best AR experiences of any products in the market today, and with the announcement of our new iPad Pro this week, we've made that gap even wider. More powerful than the vast majority of PC laptops, the new iPad Pro is unrivaled in its versatility and performance compared with the beautifully refined Apple Pencil and a new streamlined full-sized smart keyboard, iPad Pro will extend its lead as the ultimate creativity and productivity device.\",\n",
       "    'And finally, just this week we delivered the highly anticipated Group FaceTime functionality to all FaceTime enabled devices. For services, it was our best quarter ever with revenue of $10 billion. Excluding the impact of a favorable onetime accounting adjustment of $640 million a year ago, our services growth was 27%. We set new Q4 records in all of our geographic segments and new all time revenue records for the App Store, Cloud Services, Apple care, Apple Music and Apple Pay. We also continue to see strong growth in paid subscriptions reaching over 330 million in our ecosystem.',\n",
       "    'I want to spotlight the exceptional performance of Apple Pay which is by far the number one mobile contactless payment service worldwide. Transaction volume tripled year-over-year. And to put that into perspective, Apple Pay generated significantly more transactions than even PayPal Mobile with over four times the growth rate. As a testament to accelerating US growth, Costco completed the roll out Apple Pay to over 500 US warehouses last quarter while Neiman Marcus is now accepting Apple Pay at over 40 stores across the country.',\n",

       "    'We set an all-time quarterly record for Mac revenue. Thanks to strong performance of MacBook Pro and the impact of the back-to-school season. In September we delivered macOS Mojave, bringing powerful new features to Mac like dark mode stacked in a completely redesigned Mac App Store. Considered alongside the release of iOS 12, watchOS 5 and a new TV OS, macOS Mojave tells a powerful story of the seamless integration of world-class hardware, software and services that define the Apple ecosystem.',\n",
       "    \"As I mentioned at the beginning of the call, earlier this week we announced exciting updates to the Mac lineup. The all-new MacBook Air brings a stunning retina display, Touch ID, the latest processors and an even more portable design to the world's most beloved notebook.\",\n",

       "    \"The new Mac Mini boast an amazing five times faster performance than before. With revenue growth over 50%, it was another record quarter for wearables which includes Apple Watch, AirPods and Beats product. With the highest customer satisfaction in the industry, Apple Watch has become an essential part of people's lives.

These are unprecedented and potentially life-changing features, showing how Apple Watch is not only an indispensable communication and fitness companion but also an intelligent guardian for your health.',\n",
       "    'More broadly, we see this as just one further example of the kind of contribution we can make in the health space and we look forward to making more in the future.

HomePod delivers the highest fidelity audio quality working together with an Apple Music subscription to stream over 50 million songs into any room of your home.',\n",
       "    'Our retail team posted record Q4 results to conclude their biggest year ever. They are transforming our stores into places where customers come to connect learn and be inspired together with people from their community. Our Today at Apple sessions are terrific example of what that looks like in practice. We hosted over 250,000 Today at Apple sessions this quarter, connecting aspiring creators with local photographers, illustrators and other experts who can help them get the most out of their devices.',\n",
       "    'Apple stores also hosted 74,000 kids at Apple Camp. The relationship Apple has with our customers is about more than just making a purchase. With the recent addition of beautiful new stores in Italy, Japan, China and in just a few weeks Thailand, we will have 506 stores where we can further those relationships, almost half of which are outside the United States.',\n",
       "    \"Before I turn the call over to Luca, I'd like to touch on two items that may not show up in our financial statement but are just as integral to Apple's mission and our commitment to making the world a better place. First, education. More than 5,000 schools, community colleges and technical colleges worldwide are now using Everyone Can Code, our free coding curriculum. Ideas, creativity and passion for technologies potential aren't limited by ZIP code or country and we don't think opportunity should be either. We're also excited that educators in more than 350 schools around the world have started working with Everyone Can Create, the free collection of tools and project guides we introduced this Spring, designed to help unleash kids creativity throughout their school day with the help of iPad.\",\n",
       "    \"Next is the environment. This was a milestone year for Apple's commitment to our planet. In April, we announced that 100% of our global operations are powered by renewable energy. We also made progress in doing the same in our supply chain. And just this week, we announced that the inclosures of new products like MacBook Air and iPad Pro will be made from 100% recycled aluminium, a strong, durable and beautiful new alloy designed by Apple. This is a great example of how our commitment to do right on the issues that matter can drive one's unimaginable innovation, new ways of approaching old problems and beautiful solutions that set us apart.\",\n",
       "    \"I'd like to thank all of our employees, customers, developers and business partners for helping us deliver outstanding results across our fiscal 2018. We are headed into the holidays with our strongest product lineup ever and we could not be more bullish about Apple's future.\",\n",
       "    'And now, Luca has more details to share with you on the September quarter. Luca?',\n",
       "    'Thank you, Tim. Good afternoon, everyone. We are extremely pleased to report the record results for our September quarter, which capped a tremendously successful fiscal 2018, a year in which we saw double-digit revenue growth in every geographic segments and established new revenue and earnings records in every single quarter.',\n",
       "    'Revenue in the fourth quarter was $62.9 billion, up 20% and more than $10 billion over last year, with strong double-digit growth in each of our geographic segments and record Q4 revenue in the Americas, in Europe, Japan and Rest of Asia Pacific. In fact, we set new revenue records in almost every market we track, with especially strong growth in Germany, Italy, Sweden, Switzerland, Japan and Korea, all major markets where revenue growth was 25% or higher. We also set new fourth quarter revenue records for iPhone and wearables, a new all-time records for Services and Mac.',\n",
       "    'Gross margin was 38.3%, flat sequentially and in line with our expectations as leverage from higher revenue offset seasonal transition costs. We set new September quarter records for net income, EPS and cash flow from operations. Net income was $14.1 billion, up $3.4 billion or 32% over last year. Diluted earnings per share were $2.91, up 41%. Cash flow from operations was $19.5 billion, up $3.8 billion from a year ago.',\n",
       "    'iPhone revenue grew 29% with growth of more than 20% in every geographic segment. iPhone ASP was $793 compared to $618 a year ago, driven by strong performance of iPhone X, iPhone 8, iPhone 8 Plus, as well the successful launch of iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max in the September quarter this year while we launched iPhone X in the December quarter last year.',\n",
       "    \"We sold 46.9 million iPhones during the quarter, with growth of 20% or more in several markets, including Japan, Australia, New Zealand, Sweden Norway, Chile and Vietnam. Customer satisfaction with iPhone continues to be outstanding and it's the highest in the industry. The latest survey of US consumers from 451 Research indicates customer satisfaction of 98% for iPhone X, iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus combined, and among business buyers who plan to purchase smartphones in the December quarter, 80% plan to purchase iPhones.\",\n",
       "    'Turning to Services. It was our best quarter ever, in total and virtually in every market around the world with revenue of $10 billion. A year ago, we had a one-time $640 million favorable impact to Services revenue due to an accounting adjustment. And taking that into account, our services growth in Q4 this year was 27%. As Tim mentioned, we reached new all-time quarterly revenue record for many services categories and we are well on our way to achieve our goal to double our fiscal 2016 services revenue by 2020.',\n",
       "    'We now have over 330 million paid subscriptions on our platform, an increase of over 50% versus a year ago. We are very pleased, not only with the growth, but also with the breadth of our subscription business. In fact, 30,000 third-party subscription apps are available on the App Store today and the largest of them all represents less than 0.3% of our total services revenue.',\n",
       "    \"Next, I'd like to talk about the Mac. We saw great response to our new MacBook Pro models that we launched in July with strong double-digit revenue growth, driving an all-time quarterly record for Mac revenue. We were especially pleased with Mac momentum in emerging market with strong growth in Latin America, in India, the Middle East and Africa and Central and Eastern Europe. At over 100 million units, our active installed base of Mac is at an all-time high and the majority of customer purchasing Macs in the September quarter were new to Mac.\",\n",
       "    'We sold 9.7 million iPads during the quarter, gaining share in nearly every market we track, based on the latest estimates from IDC. We generated iPad growth in a number of key regions around the world, including Latin America, Europe, Japan, the India and South Asia. Among customers around the world purchasing iPads during the quarter, nearly half were new to iPad and our active installed base of iPads reached a new all-time high.',\n",
       "    'NPD indicates that iPad has 58% share of the US tablet market in the September quarter, up from 54% share a year ago. And the most recent customer consumer survey from 451 Research measured, iPad customer satisfaction ratings of 96% for both iPad and iPad Pro. And among business customers, who plan to purchase tablets in the December quarter, 74% plan to purchase iPads.',\n",
       "    'Other Products revenue grew 31% to a new September quarter record, with an increase of over $1 billion compared to a year ago. Thanks to wearables growth of over 50% and the strong performance of Apple TV, in addition to the introduction of HomePod earlier this year.',\n",
       "    \"As we look back across fiscal 2018, we have made great progress in the enterprise market where iOS is transforming our business gets done across multiple industries. In fact, over 450 airlines and 47 of the top 50 around the world have adopted iOS to have pilots life safer, more efficient flight and many airlines are also using iOS to support better customer experiences and improve maintenance operations. We're also making great strides in the retail sector where nine of the top 10 global retailers use iOS devices to transform their customer and employee experiences.\",\n",
       "    'We are seeing industry wide adoption of iOS at thousands of retailers from neighborhood boutiques to many of the best-known retailers in the world. Deployment of iOS devices is growing steadily as retailers replaced their traditional point of sales systems and use custom iOS apps on iPhones and iPad to provide a highly personalized shopping experiences.',\n",
       "    'Our success in enterprise is supported by our key partnerships. Since launching our first strategic partnership with IBM, 240 large customers have signed MobileFirst for iOS deals. Additionally, earlier in the year, we introduced two new technology offerings. IBM Watson services for Core ML and the IBM Cloud Developer Console for Apple, that are enabling businesses to combine machine learning and cloud for a new generation of dynamic, smart apps made for iOS. Over 60 new signings across numerous industries have been added since launching these new tools.',\n",
       "    \"In our new partnership with salesforce, we're excited to bring together the number one customer relationship management platform in iOS. Together with Apple Salesforce is redesigning its apps to embrace the native mobile platform with exclusive new features on iOS. The companies will also provide tools and resources for millions of Salesforce developers to build their own native apps with the new Salesforce mobile SDK for iOS.\",\n",
       "    'And finally, we recently announced Apple Business Manager, a new way for IT teams to deploy Apple devices at scale. The response from companies around the world has been tremendous with over 40,000 companies currently enrolled.',\n",
       "    'Let me now turn to our cash position. We ended the quarter with $237.1 billion in cash plus marketable securities. We also had $102.5 billion in term debt and $12 billion in commercial paper outstanding for a net cash position of $122.6 billion. As explained earlier this year, it is our plan to reach a net cash neutral position over time. As part of this plan, we returned over $23 billion to investors during the quarter. We repurchased 92.5 million Apple shares for $19.4 billion through open market transactions and we paid $3.5 billion in dividends and equivalents.',\n",
       "    'For our fiscal year 2018, revenue grew over $36 billion to $265.6 billion, an all-time record. Every geographic segments grew double-digits with new records in the Americas, Europe, Japan and rest of Asia Pacific. We also set new all-time records for net income up 23% versus last year and EPS up 29%. And we returned a total of almost $90 billion to our investors during the year, including almost $14 billion in dividends and equivalents and over $73 billion in share repurchases.',\n",
       "    \"Before we discuss our December quarter outlook, I'd like to describe a number of changes in our financial reporting that we are implementing as we enter our new fiscal year. First, given the increased importance of our Services business and in order to provide additional transparency to our financial results, we will start reporting revenue as well as cost of sales for both total products and total services beginning this December quarter. Second, also beginning this December quarter, we are adopting the FASB's new standard for revenue recognition. This will not result in any change to our total revenue, but it will impact the way we report the classification of revenue between products and services. In particular the revenue corresponding to the amortization of the deferred value of bundled services such as maps, Siri and free iCloud services was previously reported in product revenue. After adopting the new standard, this revenue will now be reported in Services revenue. The change in classification between products and services will also apply to the costs that are associated with the delivery of such bundled services.\",\n",
       "    \"After we file our 10-K, we will post a scheduled to our Investor Relations website, showing the reclassification of fiscal 2018 revenue from products to services, in connection with the adoption of the new standard. The size of this reclassification amounts to less than 1% of total company revenue. And for clarity this reclassification was not contemplated in our previously stated goal of doubling our fiscal '16 services revenue by 2020, that goal remains unchanged and excludes the revenue is now shifting from products to services over that timeframe. Third, starting the December quarter, we will no longer be providing unit sales data for iPhone, iPad and Mac.\",\n",
       "    \"As we have stated many times, our objective is to make great products and services that enrich people's lives and to provide an unparalleled customer experience so that our users are highly satisfied, loyal, and engaged. As we accomplish these objectives, strong financial results follow.\",\n",
       "    'As demonstrated by our financial performance in recent years, the number of units sold in any 90-day period is not necessarily representative of the underlying strength of our business. Furthermore a unit of sale is less relevant for us today than it was in the past given the breadth of our portfolio and the wider sales price dispersion within any given product line. Fourth, starting with the December quarter, we will be renaming, the other products category to wearables, home, and accessories to provide a more accurate description of the items that are included in this product category.',\n",
       "    \"As we move ahead into the December quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call. We have the strongest lineup ever as we enter the holiday season and we expect revenue to be between $89 billion and $93 billion, a new all-time record. This range reflect a number of factors to be considered. First we consider the effect on Q4 and Q1 of the launch timing of our new iPhones this year versus last year. Second we expect almost $2 billion of foreign exchange headwinds. Third, we have an unprecedented number of products ramping and while our ramps are going fairly well, we have uncertainty around supply and demand balance and fourth we also faced some macroeconomic uncertainty, particularly in emerging markets.\",\n",
       "    'We expect gross margin to be between 38% and 38.5%. We expect OpEx to be between $8.7 billion and $8.8 billion. We expect OI&E to be about $300 million and we expect the tax rate to be about 16.5% before discrete items. Also today, our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.73 per share of common stock, payable on November 15, 2018 with shareholders of record as of November 12, 2018.',\n",
       "    \"With that I'd like to open the call to questions.\",\n",
       "    \"Thank you, Luca. And we'd like to ask that you limit yourself to two questions. Operator, may we have the first question please.\",\n",
       "    'Questions and Answers:',\n",
       "    'Certainly. Our first question will come from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.',\n",
       "    'Yes. Thank you. Tim there has been some real deceleration in some of these emerging markets, partly driven by some concerns around some of the rules, administration is contemplating and partly driven by things that are more specific to China, for instance, like some of the regulations around gaming. So can you talk about how you see the trajectory there for the business and what you think of the initiatives of some companies like Netflix and Fortnite trying to bypass the App Store around subscriptions and I have a follow up.',\n",
       "    \"Sure. Great question. Starting with emerging markets. The emerging markets that we are seeing pressure in our markets like Turkey, India, Brazil, Russia. These are markets where currencies have weekend over the recent period, in some cases that resulted in us raising prices and those markets are not growing the way we would like to see. To give you a perspective at some detail, our business at India in Q4 was flat. Obviously, we would like to see that'd be a huge growth. Brazil was down somewhat compared to the previous year, and so I think at least the way that I see this is each one of the emerging markets has a bit of a different story. And I don't see it as an some sort of issue that is common between those for the most part. In relation to China specifically, I would not put China in that category. Our business in China was very strong last quarter. We grew 16%, which we're very happy with. iPhone in particular was very strong. Very strong double-digit growth there. Our other products category was also stronger, in fact a bit stronger than even the company, overall company number.\",\n",
       "    \"Thank you, Tim. I appreciate the response. If I could just ask you really quick on Apple's role in healthcare, it's been growing significantly since the early introduction in the Watch and then the various kits for developers, including HealthKit, CareKit etcetera. And when you combine that with your restaunch advocacy for privacy, I see, Apple could become a really large this intermediating force in all the friction in the healthcare industry today in the way, medical information is shared and distributed. Is this the way that you see the future for Apple and healthcare, and do you see a means to also grow your services business through the healthcare offerings that could become subscriptions to your customers? Thank you.\",\n",
       "    'Thank you Wamsi. Could we have the next question, please.',\n",
       "    'Shannon Cross from Cross Research has the next question.',\n",
       "    \"Thank you very much for taking the question. Given the $4 billion range in revenue that you're giving for the quarter and all of the, all the things that are going on the world right now, can you maybe give a little detail about the variables that you took into account when you were coming up with this, geopolitical trade macro component costs, I don't know if you can just give us some ideas of what the puts and takes were? Thank you.\",\n",
       "    \"The second point that needs to be kept in mind, it is a fact of live and we've dealt with for a number of years now, is the fact that when I look at currencies around the world, virtually every foreign currency has depreciated against the US dollar in the last 12 months. And when we look at the impact of foreign exchange on our revenue for the December quarter, we are looking at 200 basis points of headwinds, which translates given our, the size of our business to almost $2 billion of headwind to our revenue.\",\n",
       "    \"Yeah. Let me walk you through the rationale that we've used, and then I'll talk about this qualitative commentary that you were mentioning. As I said our objective is to make great products provide the best customer experience and get our customer satisfied, engaged and loyal to our ecosystem. When you look at our financial performance in recent years, take the last three years for example, the number of units sold during any quarter has not been necessarily preventative of the underlying strength of our business,if you look at our revenue during the last three years, if you look at our net income during the last three years, if you look at our stock price in the last three years, there is no correlation to the units sold in any given period.\",\n",
       "    \"As you know very well, in addition, our product ranges for all the major product categories become wider over time, and therefore a unit of sale is less relevant for us at this point compared to the past, because we got this much wider sales price dispersion. So unit of sale per se becomes less relevant. As I know, you're aware, by the way our top competitors in smartphones, in tablets, in computers do not provide quarterly unit sales information either. But of course, we understand that this is something of interest and when we believe that providing qualitative commentary on unit sales offers additional relevant information to investors, we will do so.\",\n",
       "    'Thank you, Shannon. Could we have the next question please?',\n",
       "    'The next question comes from Mike Olson with Piper Jaffray.',\n",
       "    \"Thanks very much and good afternoon. With the staggered iPhone launch were you able to discern any impact on the XS and XS Max from buyers potentially waiting for the XR, and what if anything can we take away from the December quarter guidance related to what you're seeing for early demand of the 10R? And then I have a follow-up. Thanks.\",\n",
       "    \"Got it. And you mentioned record levels for various components of the services business. As we look forward if growth of services is to maintain something close to the recent pace, what are the components of services that you're particularly excited about, that could drive that and be the strongest drivers. And maybe an offshoot to that, it seems like the news flow around augmented reality slowed a little bit in recent months. Is that potentially a material contributor to services in the near future? Thanks.\",\n",
       "    'Mike, as we said, during the September quarter we set new records for many, many services categories right from Apple Music to Cloud Services, to the App Store to AppleCare and Apple Pay really has an exponential trajectory right now.',\n",
       "    \"When we look at our services business, we think about the fact that we had a very large and growing installed base. The installed base of all our major product categories is at an all-time high and it's been growing over the last several quarters. So the opportunity for us to monetize our services business continues to grow over time. Of course, we are also improving the quality of the services that we provide, and if you look back, during the last three years, we've added new services to our portfolio, we added Apple Pay, we added Apple Music, we added these advertising business on our AppStore, and clearly we will want to continue to offer new services over time.\",\n",
       "    'Thank you, Mike. Could we have the next question please?',\n",
       "    \"Next, we'll go to Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley.\",\n",
       "    'Thank you, Tim. Given the current trade negotiations and broader geopolitical risk, do you have any plans to consider diversifying the supply chain and if you were to do that either on your own or sort of forced, do you think it would have significant impact on the business or profitability?',\n",
       "    \"That's helpful color. And Luca, as a follow-up. NAND prices fell significantly during the September quarter. Why aren't we seeing that flows through to margin expansion for the overall company?\",\n",
       "    'Yes.',\n",
       "    \"Let me give you the puts and takes Katy. You're correct, so we are going to be getting some benefits from commodities in general and memory in particular, memory on a sequential basis, it's about 30 basis points favorable for us, going into the December quarter, and obviously we're going to be benefiting from the leverage which is typical of our seasonality in the December quarter. On the other hand, as I mentioned before, currencies have weekend against the US dollar and the impact that we expect at the gross margin level from foreign exchange is 90 basis points headwind sequentially. And, of course, at this point in the cycle, we also have higher cost structures, because as I said, we've launched so many new products in the last six weeks. So those are the puts and takes, leverage and commodity savings on one side and FX and the new products on the other side.\",\n",
       "    'Thank you, Katy. Could we have the next question, please?',\n",
       "    \"Next we'll go to Jim Suva with Citigroup.\",\n",
       "    \"Thank you very much. A question for Tim and a question for Luca and I'll ask them at the same time, so you can decide who wants to go first or second. But operationally Tim, I think your company is at a disadvantage relative to others in India, giving where items are produced versus shipped versus tax versus installed as well as ability to own stores. So can you help us address that, is India going to potentially be a big area? I think you got about only 1% market share, but it sounded like things maybe softened there.\",\n",
       "    \"And then for Luca, there will probably be a lot of pushback about not giving iPhone unit data. It sounds like you're still going to give revenue data if I heard that correctly. But some people may fear that this now means that the iPhone units are going to start going negative year-over-year because it's easy to talk about great things and not show the details of things that are so great. So thank you very much, gentlemen.\",\n",

At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I'd like to turn the call over to Nancy Paxton, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\",\n",
       "    \"Thank you. Good afternoon and thanks to everyone for joining us. Speaking first today is Apple's CEO Tim Cook and he'll be followed by CFO Luca Maestri. After that, we'll open the call to questions from analysts. Please note that some of the information you'll hear during our discussion today will consist of forward-looking statements including, without limitation, those regarding revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, other incumbent expense, taxes, capital allocation, share repurchases, dividends, and future business outlook.\",\n",
       "    \"Actual results or trends could differ materially from our forecast. For more information please refer to the risk factors discussed in Apple's most recently filed periodic reports on form 10K and form 10Q and the form 8K filed with the FCC today along with the associated press release. Apple assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements or information, which speak as of their respective dates. I'd now like to turn the call over to Tim for introductory remarks.\",\n",
       "    \"Thank you, Nancy, and thanks to everyone for joining us. Today we're proud to report our best June quarter revenue and earnings ever thanks to the strong performance of iPhone services and wearables. We generated $53.3 billion in revenue, a new Q3 record. That's an increase of 17% over last year's results, making it our seventh consecutive quarter of accelerating growth, our fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth and our strongest rate of growth in the past eleven quarters. Our team generated record Q3 earnings per share of $2.34 an increase of 40% over last year. We are extremely proud of these results and I'd like to share some highlights with you.\",\n",
       "    'First, the iPhone had a very strong quarter. Revenue was up 20% year-over-year and our active install base grew by double-digits driven by switchers, first-time smartphone buyers, and our existing customers whose loyalty we greatly appreciate. IPhone 10 was the most popular iPhone in the quarter once again with a customer satisfaction score of 98% according to 451 Research. Based on the latest data from IDC, iPhone grew faster than the global smartphone market-gaining share in many markets including the US, greater China, Canada, Germany, Australia, Russia, Mexico, and the Middle East and Africa.',\n",
       "    \"Second, we had a stellar quarter in services, which generated an all-time record revenue of 9.5 billion fueled in part by double-digit growth in our overall active installed base. We feel great about the momentum of our services business and we're on target to reach our goal of doubling our fiscal 2016 services revenue by 2020. Our record services results were driven by strong performance in a number of areas and I'd like to briefly mention just some of these. Paid subscriptions from Apple and third parties have now surpassed 300 million, an increase of more than 60% in the past year alone.\",\n",
       "    \"Revenue from subscriptions accounts for a significant and increasing percentage of our overall services business. What's more, the number of apps offering subscriptions also continue to grow. There are almost 30,000 available in the app store today. The app store turned ten years old this month and we set a new June quarter revenue record. The app store has exceeded our wildest expectations, igniting a cultural and economic phenomenon that has changed how people work, learn, and play. Customers around the world are visiting the app store more often and downloading more apps than ever before.\",\n",
       "    \"And based on third-party research estimates, the app store generated nearly twice the revenue of Google Play so far in 2018. The app economy is thriving and thanks to the app store it's generating jobs for tens of millions of people around the world. Our developers have earned over $100 billion from the app store since its launch and we couldn't be more proud of them and what they've accomplished. We're hearing lots of developer excitement around our upcoming OS releases, which I'll talk about more in a moment, and can't wait to see what they can come up with next.\",\n",
       "    \"We've experienced rapid growth in our app store search ad service and as we announced earlier this month, we are expanding our geographic coverage to Japan, South Korea, France, Germany, Italy, and Spain. We're also seeing strong growth in many of the other services as well. Just a few examples. Apple Music grew by over 50% on a year-over-year basis. Apple Care revenue grew at its highest rate in 18 quarters partly due to our expanded distribution initiative. Cloud services revenue was also up over 50% year-over-year. Our communication services are experiencing record usage.\",\n",
       "    \"We've hit all-time highs for both the number of monthly active users of messages and the number of FaceTime calls made with growth accelerating from the March to June quarters. Siri requests have already exceeded 100 billion so far this fiscal year. And the number of articles read on Apple News more than doubled year-over-year. Apple Pay continues to expand with well over 1 billion transactions last quarter, triple the amount from just a year ago with growth accelerating for the March quarter.\",\n",
       "    'To put that tremendous growth into perspective, this past quarter we completed more total transactions than great companies like Square and more mobile transactions than PayPal. Apple Pay is now live in 24 markets worldwide with over 4,900 bank partners and we look forward to adding Germany later this year.',\n",
       "    \"We're excited to share that in the US, eBay is beginning to enable its sellers to accept Apple Pay and CVS Pharmacy and 7-11 will roll out Apple Pay acceptance in locations nationwide this fall. Transit is another important area of growth and Apple Pay can be used with iPhone and Apple Watch to quickly and conveniently ride public transit in 12 metropolitan areas. Apple Pay Cash, our peer-to-peer payment service, is already serving millions of customers across the US, less than eight months following its launch.\",\n",
       "    \"Our third highlight of the quarter is the outstanding results in wearables, which comprises Apple Watch, AirPods, and Beats, and was up over 60% year-over-year with growth accelerating from the March quarter. Our wearables revenue exceeded $10 billion over the last four quarters, a truly remarkable accomplishment for a set of products that has only been on the market for a few years. Apple Watch delivered record June quarter performance with growth in the mid 40% range. And we're thrilled to see so many customers enjoying AirPods. It reminds me of the early days of iPod when I started noticing white earbuds everywhere I went.\",\n",
       "    'A number of other notable events in the quarter: We expanded distribution of HomePod to three additional markets and we added new immersive listening features with support for HomePod stereo pairs and a new multi-room audio system. In June, we hosted an extremely successful developers conference that previewed many major advances coming this fall to our four operating systems, iOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS. Developer and customer reaction has been very positive and we have over 4 million users participating in our new OS beta programs.',\n",
       "    \"Starting with iOS12, Siri will take a major step forward with Siri shortcuts, which deliver a new, much faster way to get things done and allow any app to work with Siri. We believe this will make Siri even more useful and significantly expand its adoption. We've also designed performance improvements across iOS12 to make everyday tasks faster and more responsive. The camera launches up to 7% faster, the keyboard appears up to 50% faster, and Apps can launch up to twice as fast.\",\n",
       "    \"We've always been about empowering users to get the most from our products. But not about spending all of their time using them.

Activity reports will provide information on the amount and nature of time spent on iPhones and iPads and Screen Time will enable parents to monitor and limit their children's activity from their own iOS devices using family sharing in iCloud.

       "    'Thank you, Tim, good afternoon everyone. We are very pleased to report the financial results of our best June quarter ever. As we have done in every quarter this fiscal year, we set new quarterly records for both revenue and earnings per share with revenue up 17% year-over-year and EPS up 40%.',\n",
       "    'We generated 53.3 billion of revenue with year-over-year growth in all of our geographic segments and new June quarter records in the Americas, Europe, Japan, and rest of Asia-Pacific. We grew in each of our top 15 markets with especially strong performance in the US, Hong Kong, Russia, Mexico, the Middle East, and Africa. All places where revenue was up by more than 20%.',\n",
       "    'Gross margin was 38.3% flat sequentially as cost improvements and foreign exchange of set the season loss of leverage. Net income was 11.5 billion up 2.8 billion or 32% over last year. And it was also a new June quarter record. Diluted earnings per share with $2.34 up 40% and also a new record for the June quarter and cash flow from operations was very strong at 14.5 billion. IPhone revenue grew 20% year-over-year with iPhone ASP increasing to $724 from $606 a year ago driven by the strong performance of iPhone 10, iPhone 8, iPhone 8 Plus across the world.',\n",
       "    'During the quarter, we saw 41.3 million iPhones with double-digit unit growth in several markets including the US, Canada, Germany, Switzerland, Mexico, Hong Kong, Russia, the Middle East, and Africa. Our performance from a customer demand standpoint was stronger than our reported result as we reduced iPhone channel inventory by 3.5 million units during the quarter. We exited the June quarter toward the lower end of our target range of five to seven weeks of iPhone channel inventory. Customer satisfaction with the iPhone continues to be outstanding and is the highest in the industry. The latest survey of US consumers from 451 Research indicates that across all iPhone models, customer satisfaction was 96% and combining iPhone 8, 8 Plus, and iPhone 10, it was even higher, at 98%. And among business buyers who plan to purchase iPhones in the September quarter, 81% plan to purchase iPhones up 3 points from the last survey.',\n",

Services revenue included a favorable 236 million one-time item in connection with the final resolution of various lawsuits. Excluding these amounts, services revenue was still an all-time record and the underlying growth rate of our services business was a terrific 28% over last year. We generated double-digit services growth in all of our geographic segments and the App Store, Apple Care, Apple Music, Cloud services, and Apple Pay, all set new June quarter records.',\n",

Our year-over-year sales was impacted by the different timing of the MacBook Pro launch, which did not occur until early Q4 this year as opposed to June last year with the subsequent channel fill during the June quarter. Even with the difficult launch comparison, we saw great momentum in many emerging markets with growth well into double-digits and we established new June quarter records for Mac sales in India, Turkey, Chile, and Central and Eastern Europe.',\n",

Almost half of iPad purchases in the quarter were by customers new to IPad and our active installed base of iPads reached a new all-time high.',\n",

MPD indicates that iPad is a 60% share of the US tablet market in the June quarter up from 51% share a year ago.

       "    'Thank you. Our first question comes from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley.',\n",
       "    \"Thank you and congrats on the quarter. I'll ask both of my questions up front. First for Tim: You're on track to hit your services revenue target even earlier than planned. How are you thinking about the next legs of services growth as you move into the next three to five years?\",\n",
       "    \"And then, for you, Luca: Man prices are falling this year, services mix is rising, those should both positively influence gross margins and get we're seeing gross margin sort of hang out here at 38%. What are the offsetting headwinds and is it possible that we could see the tailwinds start to overpower those headwinds in the next couple quarters and see gross margins drift higher? Thank you.\",\n",
       "    \"Katy thanks for your questions. On the services side, we're thrilled with the results. They were very broad-based. We had double-digit services growth in all of the geographic segments. And the App Store, Apple Care, Apple Music, Cloud services, Apple Pay, all set new June quarter records and of course subscriptions have now passed 300 million, as I had mentioned before. And so we couldn't be happier with how things are going.\",\n",
       "    \"In terms of the next leg of this, given the momentum that we're seeing across the board, we feel great about our current services but obviously, we're also thrilled about our pipeline that have some new services in it as well. And so with the combination of these, we feel great about hitting our objective and maybe even doing a little better.\",\n",
       "    \"Katy, for margins, let me tell you about the puts and takes for the June quarter and then I'll talk about the guidance for Q4 and make some general observations for the future. Starting with the June quarter, typically we see a decline in gross margin going from the March quarter to the June quarter. Last year, we were down 40 bps, two years ago, we were down 140 bps. This year, we were able to keep June flat sequentially.\",\n",
       "    \"During the quarter, we always have some loss of leverage because of our typical seasonality. This year, we were able to offset that with some cost improvements and also we had some favorability in foreign exchange on a sequential basis. Unfortunately, as you know, the US dollar is already appreciated again so we do not expect to see that favorability to repeat during the September quarter. Those are the puts and takes for June and we're very happy to see gross margin sequentially flat for June.\",\n",
       "    \"For September, we're also guiding about flat sequentially at the midpoint. As you know, we typically have, what we call, product transition costs, during the September quarter. And this year we also have about 30 bps of headwind from foreign exchange. Again, because the dollar has appreciated recently. We expect those two factors to be offset by positive leverage because we've seen the revenue guidance that we provided and the mix to services that you've actually mentioned during the question. So we feel pretty good about also the guidance for the fourth quarter.\",\n",
       "    \"Looking forward, we don't provide guidance beyond the cutting quarter but I think you know we have a pretty good record over the last several years to make good business decisions balancing units, revenue, and margins. As you know, foreign exchange has been a very significant headwind over the last three-plus years. But we've been able to manage that. On the memory front, it is true that prices have started to decline. It has been a significant headwind for the last 12, 18 months, and still in the June quarter was a negative. We believe that we're gonna start seeing some improvement from here on.\",\n",
       "    'Our next question will come from Shannon Cross with Cross Research.',\n",
       "    \"At the unit level, the iPhone SC had a difficult comped year ago quarter so when we changed some of the memory configurations in the year-ago quarter. If you look at it on a geographic basis, the top three selling phones in urban China were iPhone, where iPhone 10 was number one and has been for a couple of quarters. And iPhones make up three of the top five smartphones in the US, UK, and Japan. And so, it's difficult sometimes to get a read over exactly what's happening in the market but given the industry numbers that we've seen, it's clear that we picked up global market share and picked up market share in several countries, not only iPhone but iPad as well.\",\n",
       "    \"Great, thank you. And then, can you talk a bit about Greater China of 19% year-over-year during the quarter? Obviously, iPhone doing well, but some concern that maybe some of what's going off in the trade world might have impacted doesn't seem like that. So I'm just curious as to what you're seeing in China and how you're thinking about it as you look forward? Thank you.\",\n",
       "    \"Yeah, so it's a good question, thank you. This is the fourth consecutive quarter that we've had double-digit growth in Greater China. I mentioned how iPhone 10 and the iPhones are selling. We did pick up share in iPhone and iPad. But if you look more holistically at our complete line, we had double-digit growth from services to iPad to iPhone and to our other product category, which the Watch did extremely well. So there are lots of good things happening there.\",\n",
       "    \"In terms of the tariffs themselves, maybe I could sort of take a step back because I'm sure a lot of people have questions on this. Our view on tariffs is that they show up as a tax on the consumer and wind up resulting in lower economic growth and sometimes can bring about significant risk of unintended consequences. That said, the trade relationships and agreements that the US has between the US and other major economies are very complex and it's clear that several are in need of modernizing. But we think that in the vast majority of situations that tariffs are not the approach to doing that. And so we're sort of encouraging dialogue and so forth.\",\n",
       "    \"It's actually a tedious process in going through it because you not only have to analyze the revenue products, which are a bit more straightforward to analyze, but you also have to analyze the purchases that you're making through other companies that are not related to revenue, maybe they're related to data centers and this sort of thing. And so, we're going through that now and we'll be sharing our results later on those and feeding back public comment. Of course, the risk associated with more of a macroeconomic issue, such as an economic slowdown in one or more countries, or currency fluctuations that are related to tariffs is very difficult to quantify. And we're not even trying to quantify that, to be clear about it.\",\n",
       "    \"All of this said we're optimistic, as I've been the whole time that this will get sorted out. Because there's an inescapable mutuality between the US and China that sort of serves as a magnet to bring both countries together. Each country can only prosper if the other does. And of course, the world needs both the US and China to prosper for the world to do well. With that said, I can't predict the future but I am optimistic that the countries will get through this. And we are hoping that calm heads prevail.\",\n",

And also Apple Music, if you can give us a little more color or an update maybe around paid subscribers or total subscribers around Apple Music and how you feel that's rolled out.\",\n",
       "    \"Sure, Brian, thanks for the question. We're very excited to work with Oprah; we think that her incomparable ability and talent to connect with audiences around the world there's no match. And we think that we can do some great and original content together so we could not be happier in working with Oprah. As you know, we hired two highly respected television executives last year and they have been here now for several months and have been working on a project that we're not really ready to share all the details of it yet but I couldn't be more excited about what's going on there. We've got great talent in the area that we've sourced from different places and feel really good about what we will eventually offer.\",\n",
       "    \"In terms of the key catalyst and the changes, the court cutting in our view is only going to accelerate and probably accelerate at a much faster rate than is widely thought. We're seeing the things that we have on the periphery of this like Apple TV units and revenue grew by very strong double-digits in Q3. As I mentioned in my opening comments, we're seeing different providers pick up the Apple TV and use it as their box to go to market with their subscription service. There are, within the 300 million plus paid subscriptions, some of these are third-party video subscriptions and we see the growth that is going on there. It's like 100% year-over-year.\",\n",
       "    \"And so, all the forcing functions here from the outside all point to dramatic changes speeding up in the content industry and so we're really happy to be working on something just not ready to talk about it in depth today. In terms of Apple Music, we're well over 50 million listeners now when you add our paid subscribers and the folks on the trial and so we're moving along at a very, very good rate.\",\n",
       "    \"Because if you add everyone up that's providing subscription music today, or streaming music, outside of China it's less than 200 million probably around the world. So it does seem to me there's an extraordinary opportunity in that business to grow the market well. And I think if we put our there, which we are doing, that will be a beneficiary of that, as other people will, as well. I like where we are. Our revenues on Apple Music grew over 50%, as I'd mentioned earlier, during the quarter. Some really strong results. Thanks for the question.\",\n",
       "    'Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein has our next question.',\n",
       "    \"I have one for Luca and one for Tim, please. Luca, I'm wondering as we think about modeling Q4, iPhone ASPs are typically up sequentially about 2% to 4%, sort of low single digits. Perhaps you can help us think through how we should be thinking about Q4? I know you provided some commentary last quarter on how we should be thinking about Q3 ASPs.\",\n",
       "    \"Toni, as you know, we do not provide guidance for either units or ASPs for any product category but, of course, we provide a guidance on revenue and the guidance range implies growth of 16% to 19%. We expect the growth to come from strong growth from iPhone, from services, and from wearables, which has been a bit of our pattern during the course of the year. On iPhone ASP, the only thing that I will point out is that obviously, we're exiting the June quarter at a significantly higher level than in the past and so that I think is important to keep in mind as we move into the September quarter. Its important o keep in mind the type of revenue growth that we've implied in our guidance.\",\n",
       "    \"Thank you. Tim, I was wondering if you could just comment a little bit about the health of the smartphone market? Apple's smartphone iPhone units have been relatively flat for four years and I think you've probably been a share gainer during the period, which would suggest at least at the high end the market that is perhaps flat to down. And I'm wondering if you can comment on A. whether you believe that and what you think might be happening with replacement cycles? And specifically, also what impact, if any, you've seen from wider availability and less expensive replacement batteries for iPhones?\",\n",
       "    \"I think the smartphone market is very healthy. I think it's actually the best market in the world to be in for someone that is in the business that we're in. It's an enormous sized market and whether it grows, from our point of view, whether it grows 1% or 2% or 5% or 6% or 10% or shrinks 1% or 2%, it's a great market because it's just huge. So that's kind of the way that I view that. IPhone revenues are up 20% for the quarter over last year. We're really pleased with that. And if you look at the cycle, which I'll define as Q1, Q2, Q3, for ease, you'll see that we've grown mid-single-digits and on an average weekly sales point of view.\",\n",
       "    \"And of course, double-digit on ASP so I think it's really healthy. In terms of replacement cycles, as I've mentioned I think on a previous call, some replacement cycles are lengthening. I think that the major catalyst for that was probably the subsidy plans becoming a much smaller percentage of total sales around the world than they were at one time. So I think some are lengthening. But I think for us, the thing that we always have to do is come out with a really great innovative product.\",\n",
       "    \"And I think that iPhone 10 shows that when you deliver great innovative product there are enough people there that would like that and it can be a really good business. And so that's how I look at that. In terms of our installed base, which is something very important for us, as it is one of the key drivers of services, our active installed base on iPhone grew double-digits over last year during the quarter. So we're thrilled with that and you can see that carrying through to the services line in the growth that we have there.\",\n",
       "    \"In terms of batteries, we have never done an analysis internally about how many people decided to get a lower priced battery than buying another phone because it was never about that for us. It was always about doing something great for the user. And I think if you treat the users and the customers well, then you have a good business over time. That's how we look at that.\",\n",
       "    \"Next, we'll take a question from Laura Martin from Needham.\",\n",
       "    \"I'd like to focus on product roadmap and strategy. There is a war going on for the home, the connected home, over the internet of sings, and with two products: the HomePod and Apple TV and the home. My question is, strategically, how do you feel about the importance of being in the home and whether it threatens your dominance outside the home with your core business in the mobile devices? If you sort of lose that battle. I'm just trying to figure out strategically when you think about where the puck's going, how important is it for you to have a beachhead in the home as well as out of home?\",\n",
       "    \"I think the home business is bigger than the HomePod and Apple TV. They're both important products clearly, but everybody has their iPhone at home, as well. And everybody has their home at Mac, and everyone has their iPad at home. In terms of the Siri access points, as you can tell from the 100 billion number I quoted in the script, there's an extraordinary amount of usage of these products that are used to perform home-related functions.\",\n",
       "    \"I do that every day with controlling all my home automation and so on and so forth. Part of that is on HomePod but part of it is with the Apple Watch and the iPhone and the iPad. And so, I think home is important. Home is important, work is important, the movement between the two are important. Health is important. So the smartphone has become the repository that goes across the whole of your life, not something that is just meant for a portion of it. And so, I think all of those are important and we're focused on all of them.\",\n",
       "    \"Yeah, sort of. I mean, I'll watch your product roadmap and be able to tell what the answer is. The other thing I get in fights with investors about the most is this, and I'd love your insight on this. I love the expansion of the new products. The question I have is, are they actually on-ramp into the Apple ecosystem? The Beats, the Watch, the AirPods, Subscriptions, are they on-ramps into the ecosystem or is the on-ramp to the ecosystem the iPhone and then these new products add revenue per member once you get somebody into the ecosystem via the iPhone?\",\n",
       "    \"A lot of people that buy Apple products buy for the whole ecosystem, even though they might not currently use all the different products. And so, the way that I think about those products, are there products within the ecosystem itself? The AirPods have really gone through the roof and the Apple Watch has hidden their pocket and has gone to a whole different level as I've mentioned earlier with our overall wearables revenue. And so, in my view, they are a core part of the ecosystem.\",\n",
       "    'But they attract a new person to the ecosystem or does the person have to have an iPhone first?',\n",
       "    \"On your port though, it is clear from communications I've had with users, that some of them were attracted to iPhone because of the Apple Watch. And so the Apple Watch led them to the iPhone. The reverse of that is also true, is that somebody got the iPhone and then decided I really want something to coach me in fitness and to curate some of the communications and so forth like the watch does so well. And so, it's not always a linear path. I see these things as being somewhat fluid in different for each user.\",\n",

       "    \"Thank you, Nancy, and to everyone joining us, welcome. We're proud to announce the results of a very successful quarter today, setting new March quarter records for both revenue and earnings. We generated $61.1 billion of revenue. That's up 16% from last year, making it our sixth consecutive quarter of accelerating revenue growth. Our performance was broad-based, with iPhone revenue of 14%, services up 31%, and wearables up almost 50%. We grew in each of our geographic segments, and in Greater China and Japan, revenue was up more than 20%. iPhone's second quarter performance capped a tremendous fiscal first half, with $100 billion in iPhone revenue, an increase of $12 billion over last year, setting a new first half record and achieving our highest first half growth rate in three years.\",\n",
       "    \"iPhone gained share during the quarter based on IDC's latest estimates for the global smartphone market. And customers chose iPhone X more than any other iPhone each week in the March quarter, just as they did following its launch in the December quarter. Since we split the line with the launch of iPhone 6 and 6 Plus in 2014, this is the first cycle in which the top of the line iPhone model has also been the most popular.\",\n",
       "    \"Q2 was our best quarter ever for services, and momentum there continues to be incredibly strong. Revenue topped $9 billion for the first time, up more than $2 billion over last year's March quarter. We had all-time record revenue from the app store from Apple Music, from iCloud, from Apple Pay, and more, all of which are a powerful illustration of the importance of our huge active installed base of devices and the loyalty and engagement of our customers.\",\n",
       "    'Across all our services, paid subscriptions surpassed 270 million, up over 100 million from a year ago, and up 30 million in the last 90 days alone, contributing to the overall increase in services revenue. Apple Pay continues its strong growth, with active users more than doubling and transactions tripling year-over-year. We believe the availability of Apple Pay at major transit systems has been a key driver of adoption among commuters. And in March, we launched Express Transit with Apple Pay in Beijing and Shanghai, the second and third largest transit systems in the world. Apple Pay is already the most successful mobile transit payment system in Tokyo, which has the busiest transit system of all. With the launch of Brazil in April, Apple Pay is now available in 21 markets, and we expect Norway, Poland, and Ukraine to launch in the next several months.',\n",
       "    'This was another outstanding quarter for our wearables business, which includes Apple Watch, Beats, and AirPods, with combined revenue of almost 50% year-over-year. Looking at its revenue over the last four quarters, our wearables business is now the size of a Fortune 300 company.',\n",
       "    'Apple Watch had another great quarter, with revenue growing by strong double digits year-over-year to a new March quarter record. Millions of customers are using Apple Watch to help them stay active, healthy, and connected, and they have made it the top-selling watch in the world. We launched carrier support for Series 3 with Cellular in Mainland China, Hong Kong, and Thailand during the quarter, with more markets on the way. And now, with watchOS 4.2, there are more features than ever before. For example, in addition to tracking your workouts and heart rate, skiers and snowboarders can record runs, see vertical descent, and calculate speed, as well as contribute data directly to the Apple Watch Activity app.',\n",
       "    \"In addition, to our successful Everyone Can code initiative, we've launched Everyone Can Create. It's a new, free curriculum that makes it fun and easy for teachers to integrate drawing, music, filmmaking, or photography into their existing lesson plans for any subject. We believe education is the great equalizer, and whether it's through our coding programs, our unrivaled augmented reality platform, or the creativity both can unleash, we're proud to help students everywhere reach new frontiers of learning with Apple technology.\",\n",
       "    \"Consistent with our long-term focus, privacy is a key element of these initiatives for education and personal health. We're relentless about making the best products and experiences in the world while fiercely protecting our users' privacy, because we believe privacy is a fundamental human right.\",\n",
       "    \"Our environmental initiative recently passed an important milestone. All of our global facilities across 43 countries are now powered with 100% clean energy. We work with communities around the world to build clean power sources. Apple now has 25 renewable energy projects operational and 15 more under construction. We're also driving our supply chain to use clean energy. As of last month, 23 of our suppliers are committed to operating on 100% renewable energy.\",\n",
       "    \"We're now halfway through our fiscal 2018 with nearly $150 billion in revenues and double-digit growth in all of our geographic segments. We've generated almost $34 billion in earnings in six months, and we're very bullish on Apple's future. We have the best pipeline of products and services we've ever had. We have a huge installed base of active devices that is growing across all products, and we have the highest customer loyalty and satisfaction in the industry. Our services business is growing dramatically. Our balance sheet and our cash flow generation are strong, and that allows us to invest significantly in our product road map and still return a very meaningful amount of capital to our shareholders.\",\n",
       "    \"Recent corporate tax reform enables us to deploy our global cash more efficiently. In the United States, we expect our direct investment in the economy to exceed $350 billion over the next five years, including $30 billion in capital expenditures, and we expect to create over 20,000 U.S. jobs at Apple over that timeframe. We're narrowing the site selection for a new U.S. campus, and we look forward to sharing more information on that later this year.\",\n",
       "    \"Consistent with our annual cadence, today we're providing an update on our capital return program. Tax reform makes it possible for us to execute our program more efficiently, both through share repurchases and payment of dividend to the tens of millions of investors who own Apple stock either directly or indirectly, from large pension funds to individuals with a retirement account. So, today, given our strong confidence in Apple's future, we're announcing a significant update to our capital return program. Our Board of Directors has approved a new $100 billion share repurchase authorization, as well as a 16% in our quarterly dividend, effective with our next dividend payable later this month.\",\n",
       "    \"Luca will provide more details about our program, as well as a more in-depth discussion of the quarter's results. So, I'll now turn the call over to him. Luca?\",\n",
       "    \"Thank you, Tim. Good afternoon, everyone. We're very pleased to report record financial results for our March quarter, with revenue growth of 16%, EPS up 30%. Starting with revenue, we generated $61.1 billion, our highest ever for a March quarter. Revenue grew in all of our geographic segments, setting new Q2 records in most countries we track. Performance was very strong in emerging markets, where revenue was up 20%, and we were especially pleased to see 21% year-over-year growth in Greater China, our strongest growth rate from that segment in ten quarters. We also set Q2 revenue records in the Americas, in Europe, and in Japan.\",\n",
       "    'Gross margin was 38.3%, essentially flat sequentially as we offset the seasonal loss of leverage with cost improvements and a shifting mix toward services. Operating margin was 26% of revenue. Net income was $13.8 billion, up $2.8 billion over last year and a March quarter record. Diluted earnings per share were $2.73, up 30% to our new record for Q2, and cash flow from operations was very strong, at $15.1 billion.',\n",
       "    'iPhone revenue grew 14% year-over-year, with iPhone ASP increasing to $728.00 from $655.00 a year ago, driven primarily by the performance of iPhone X, iPhone 8, and iPhone 8 Plus. During the quarter, we sold 52.2 million iPhones, up 3% over last year, and we grew iPhone units by double digits in several markets, including Japan, Canada, Switzerland, Turkey, Central and Eastern Europe, Mexico, and Vietnam. Our performance from a customer demand standpoint was even stronger than our reported results, as we reduced iPhone channel inventory by 1.8 million units, 600,000 units more than the March quarter reduction last year. We exited the March quarter within our target range of five to seven weeks of iPhone channel inventory. Our customers are extremely happy with their iPhones. The latest survey of U.S. consumers from 451 Research indicates that across all iPhone models, the customer satisfaction rating was 95%, and combining 8, 8 Plus, and iPhone X, customer satisfaction was even higher, at 99%. And among business buyers who plan to purchase smartphones in the June quarter, 78% plan to purchase iPhones.',\n",
       "    \"Turning to services, we had a sensational quarter, with all-time record revenue of $9.2 billion. And that's up more than $2 billion from last year, an increase of 31%, and double the services revenue we generated in the March quarter just four years ago. Our services business is growing at a very fast pace all around the world, with revenue up more than 25% year-over-year in each of our five geographic segments. The App Store set a new all-time revenue record in the March quarter, and Apple Music reached a new record for both revenue and paid subscribers, which are now past 40 million. iCloud storage revenue was up by over 50% year-over-year to a new all-time record, and Apple Care revenue grew at its highest rate in five quarters, setting a new March quarter record.\",\n",
       "    'Our other product category also set a new record for the March quarter, with revenue of almost $4 billion. We began shipping HomePod in February, and unit sales of both Apple Watch and AirPods reached a new high for the March quarter. When we combined all our wearables and home products, they accounted for over 90% of the total growth in the other products category.',\n",
       "    \"Next, I'd like to talk about the Mac, which set a new March quarter revenue record, including new records in both the Americas and Greater China. We sold 4.1 million Macs, generating year-over-year growth in many emerging markets, including Latin America, the Middle East and Africa, Central and Eastern Europe, and India. We were happy to see double-digit growth in our active installed base of Macs to a new all-time high, with almost 60% of March quarter purchases coming from customers who are new to Mac.\",\n",
       "    'iPad grew both units and revenue for the fourth consecutive quarter. We sod 9.1 million iPads, and about half of purchases were by customers new to iPad. Growth was particularly strong in Japan, Latin America, Middle East and Africa, and Central and Eastern Europe. All markets for iPad sales were up double digits compared to a year ago. We gained share of the global tablet market based on the latest estimates from IDC, and our active installed base of iPads reached an all-time high. NPD indicates that iPad has 53% of the U.S. tablet market in the March quarter, up from 40% share a year ago. And the most recent customer survey from 451 Research measured iPad customer satisfaction ratings of 95%. And among business customers who plan to purchase tablets in the June quarter, 73% plan to purchase iPads.',\n",
       "    'We continue to make great strides in the enterprise market. In February, we announced a new cyber risk management solution for businesses with Cisco, Aeon, and Alliance. This combined approach is an industry first that integrates the most secure technology from Apple and Cisco, cyber resilience evaluation service from Aeon, and options for enhanced cyber insurance coverage from Alliance. Organizations will now be able to better manage and protect themselves from cyber risks associated with ransomware and other malware-related threats. We are thrilled that insurance industry leaders recognized that Apple products provide superior security.',\n",
       "    'In March, we announced two new services with IBM to bring more dynamic and intelligent insights into apps. IBM Watson Services for Core ML and IBM Cloud Developer Consult for Apple will enable developers to more easily build native iOS apps that bring together machine learning with artificial intelligence and cloud services.',\n",
       "    'In healthcare, iPhones are being used across leading health systems, including Cedars-Sinai, the Mayo Clinic, and HCA Healthcare, with iOS apps to support clinical workflows, communications, and care delivery. In fact, HCA Healthcare recently announced they plan to deploy 100,00 iPhones across their hospital sites within the next three years.',\n",
       "    'We had great performance from our retail and online stores, which produced their highest March quarter revenue ever. Year-over-year growth was led by iPhone, as well as strong performance from AirPods and the introduction of HomePod. Our stores hosted more than 250,000 of our very popular Today at Apple sessions, with a particular emphasis on coding and app design. During the quarter, we opened beautiful new stores in South Korea and in Austria, our first in both countries, and three weeks ago, we opened our newest store in Tokyo, bringing us to 502 stores across the world today.',\n",
       "    'Let me now turn to our cash position. We ended the quarter with $267.2 billion in cash, plus marketable securities, and we had $110 billion in term debt and $12 billion in commercial paper outstanding, for a net cash position of $145 billion. We returned nearly $27 billion to investors during the quarter. We paid $3.2 billion in dividends and equivalents, and spent $23.5 billion on repurchases of 137 million Apple shares to open market transactions. We also retired 5.7 million shares upon the completion of our 13 ASR during the quarter. We have now completed over $275 billion of our current $300 billion capital return program, including $200 billion in share repurchases against our cumulative $210 billion buyback program. We will complete the $210 billion program during the June quarter, three full quarters sooner than initially planned.',\n",
       "    'The biggest priorities for our cash have now changed over the years. We want to maintain the cash we need to fund our day-to-day operations, to invest in our future, and to provide flexibility so that we can respond effectively to the strategic opportunities we encounter along the way. As we said 90 days ago, the new tax legislation enacted in December gives us increased financial and operational flexibility from the access to our global cash. It allows us to invest for growth in the United States more efficiently, and it also provides us the opportunity to work toward a more optimal capital structure. As we said in February, our goal is to become approximately net cash neutral over time.',\n",
       "    \"Given our strong confidence in Apple's future and the value that we see in our stock, our board has authorized a new $100 billion share repurchase program, which we will start executing during the June quarter. Considering the unprecedented size of this new authorization, we want to be particularly thoughtful and flexible in our approach to repurchasing shares. Our intention is to execute our program efficiently and at a fast pace. As in the past, we will provide regular updates on our capital return activities at the end of every quarter.\",\n",
       "    \"We're also raising our dividend for the sixth time in less than six years, as we know it is very important to our investors who value income. The quarterly dividend will grow from $0.63 to $0.73 per share, an increase of 16%. This is effective with our next dividend, which the board has declared today payable on May 17, 2018 to shareholders of record as of May 14, 2018. With over $13 billion in annual dividend payments, we are proud to be among the largest dividend payers in the world, and we continue to plan for annual dividend increases going forward.\",\n",
       "    'We will continue to review our capital allocation regularly, taking into account the needs of our business, our investment opportunities, and our financial outlook. We will also continue to solicit input on our program from a broad base of shareholders. This approach will allow us to be flexible and thoughtful about the size, the mix, and the pace of our program. We expect to provide a new update to our capital allocation plans approximately 12 months from now.',\n",
       "    \"As we move ahead into the June quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call. We expect revenue to be between $51.5 and $53.5 billion. We expect gross margin to be between 38 and 38.5%. We expect opex to be between $7.7 and $7.8 billion. We expect OI&E to be about $400 million, and we expect our tax rate to be about 14.5%.\",\n",
       "    \"With that, I'd like to open the call to questions.\",\n",
       "    'Questions and Answers:',\n",
       "    'Thank you, Luca. And we ask that you limit yourself to one one-part question and one follow-up. May we have the first question, please?',\n",
       "    'Ladies and gentlemen, to ask a question, you may do so by pressing *1. Your first question will come from Shannon Cross of Cross Research.',\n",
       "    \"Thank you very much. I wanted to ask about your thoughts on sort of iPhone and positioning now that we're a couple of quarters out from the launch of the iPhone X. Given the $1,000.00 price point, and it's clearly selling, but there's been a lot of questions in the market about the sustainability of that price point and how you're thinking about it as you look out sort of holistically across your lineup. So, if you could talk a bit about what you're hearing from your customers on that, and then I have a follow up. Thank you.\",\n",
       "    \"Sure. Shannon, it's Tim. As Luca mentioned earlier, our revenues are up 14% year-over-year on iPhone, and that's a combination of single-digit unit growth and ASP growth that is mainly driven by iPhone X. I think that our iPhone line shows that there's a variety of different customers in a market that is as large as the smartphone market, and so we're going to continue to provide different iPhones for folks to meet their needs.\",\n",
       "    \"On iPhone X specifically, I think it's important to maybe emphasize again one of the things I mentioned in my opening comments, that customers chose iPhone X more than any other iPhone each and every week in the March quarter, just as they did following its launch in the December quarter. Also, since we split the line with the launch of iPhone 6 and 6 Plus back in 2014, this is the first cycle that we've ever had where the top of the line iPhone model has also been the most popular. And so, with the customer set that Luca referenced as well, the 99%, the iPhone X is a beloved product. And so, I think that it's one of those things where like, a team wins the Super Bowl. Maybe you wanted them to win by a few more points, but it's a Super Bowl winner, and that's how we feel about it. I could not be prouder of the product.\",\n",
       "    \"Yeah. Shannon, you know that we've always generated a significant amount of cash through working capital. We've got a negative cash conversion cycle, and we plan to continue to have that. Our inventory level has gone up. It's just a temporary event. We have decided to make some purchasing decisions given current market conditions, and that should unwind over time.\",\n",
       "    'So, that was essentially component purchases?',\n",
       "    'Correct.',\n",
       "    'Thank you, Shannon.',\n",
       "    'Okay. Thank you very much.',\n",
       "    'Can we have the next question, please?',\n",
       "    'From Morgan Stanley, Katy Huberty.',\n",
       "    'Thank you. Good afternoon. The services growth acceleration is really the highlight this quarter, in my mind. Can you talk about what the biggest drivers, whether it be products or regions, that drove the acceleration, and do you think that we can continue to see growth north of 30%? And then I have a follow-up.',\n",
       "    \"In terms of forecasting moving forward, we've obviously made an assumption for our guidance that Luca provided earlier. And in terms of longer term, we're on target to our 2020 goal of doubling the services revenue of '16, as we had talked about previously.\",\n",
       "    \"And it doesn't look like the threat of a trade war with China slowed down that business. In fact, growth accelerated. But anything anecdotally that you see in the business in recent weeks that would suggest that that is having an impact on demand, and any actions that Apple is taking as a company to pre-empt any risk of tariffs going forward?\",\n",
       "    'Thank you, Katy. Could we have the next question, please?',\n",
       "    'And that will come from Mike Olson with Piper Jaffray.',\n",
       "    \"Hey. Good afternoon, and thank you for taking my question. Just following on the services question, I'd be curious as to what the next drivers of services revenue are. Will it be continued penetration of Music and Pay that you see as kind of the largest future categories of incremental growth, or maybe when could augmented reality become a material part of services? And then I have a follow-up.\",\n",
       "    \"Okay. And then any potential tariff issues aside, what's working for Apple in China right now? You talked about it being the strongest year-over-year growth in ten quarters. I guess, what's driving that? Is it iPhone X specifically, or something else that's behind that improvement? Thank you.\",\n",
       "    'Thanks, Mike. Could we have the next question, please?',\n",
       "    'From RBC Capital Markets, Amit Daryanani.',\n",
       "    \"Thanks a lot. Two questions from me as well. I guess first one, just touching on the gross margin dynamics, if I look at the guidance for June on a year-over-year basis, I think sales are up double-digit, but gross margins are still flat at the high end, maybe down 20 basis points at the midpoint. Can you just talk about what's driving the lack of leverage in the gross margin basis on a year-over-year basis for June?\",\n",
       "    \"Yeah. Amit, it's Luca. We tend to look at our gross margin dynamics on a sequential basis, and essentially, we're guiding to about flat on a sequential basis. On a year-over-year basis, it's less relevant for our business. But in general, I would say that this year, we are seeing a more difficult cost environment. Particularly, we're still dealing with about 70 basis points of impact from the memory pricing environment that we're working through.\",\n",
       "    \"Got it. And if I could just follow up. Tim, you've been fairly vocal, I think, talking about the need for better privacy protection and well-crafted regulation over time. Could you just maybe help us understand, how does Apple protect consumer data, and how does this ongoing debate around data protection translate into a positive for Apple over time?\",\n",
       "    \"We protect it by encrypting it, and we keep the bulk of information or a significant amount of information on the device so that the user is in control of it. We also collect much less overall than others do. Because if you look at our model, if we can convince you to buy an iPhone or an iPad, we'll make a little bit of money. You're not our product. So, that's how we look at that.\",\n",
       "    \"In terms of benefit, we don't really view it like that. We view that privacy is a fundamental human right, and that it's an extremely complex situation if you're a user to understand a lot of the user agreements and so forth. And we've always viewed that part of our role was to sort of make things as simple as possible for the user and provide them a level of privacy and security. And so, that's how we look at it.\",\n",
       "    'Thank you, Amit. Could we have the next question, please?',\n",
       "    \"We'll go to Steve Milunovich with UBS.\",\n",
       "    'Great. Thank you. Luca, could you talk a bit more about the capital allocation? The dividend increase of 16% was relatively low relative to what you could have done, so are you really thinking the stock price is attractive here? And you said you would execute the buyback at a fast pace. Can you give us any timeframe of that $100 billion? And how much debt do you think about in terms of net cash zero?',\n",
       "    \"Yes. Let's start with the dividend. We're increasing it by 16%. This is the largest increase that we've done since we've reintroduced the dividend back in August of 2012. So, we think it's a very meaningful increase for all the investors that value income. Obviously, when we come down to capital allocation decisions, we obviously also keep in mind the opportunity for us to do some M&A activities, which we do in an ongoing basis. But when it comes down between dividends and buyback, our view is that for a variety of reasons, we see a lot of value in the stock. We believe the stock is undervalued, and so we have a bias toward the buyback. So, the dividend is a very large component of capital return because we're going to be returning more than $13 billion a year to investors through dividends. But we believe that given where we are with the valuation of the stock, we think that we continue to do the buyback primarily.\",\n",
       "    \"Thank you. And Tim, could you talk a bit about your healthcare opportunity? Is it merely selling watches over time, or do you think more broadly about it? Is there a services play? You're doing some things for your employees. Could that potentially broaden out? How do you think about the opportunity there?\",\n",
       "    'Thanks, Steve. Could we have the next question, please?',\n",
       "    \"We'll go to Brian White with Monness Crespi.\",\n",
       "    \"China, I continue to believe, is a phenomenal country with lots of opportunity from a market point of view, but also lots of opportunity from an app developer point of view. We have almost two million application developers in China that are writing apps for iOS and the App Store, and they're doing unbelievably creative work and innovative work. And so, we look at China holistically, not only as a market.\",\n",

Tim, strategically, when we talk to investors, they often say, \"Oh, the iPhone market is saturated. There\\'s not much room for growth.\" Yet when we do our analysis, we kind of still see emerging markets like India and all those still are growth. When you think about India and those markets, do you kind of believe that some of those markets could get to much higher or a more normalized market share that you have in some of the developing countries over time? And can you talk a little bit about some of those efforts you may be doing?',\n",
       "    \"And then Luca, on the question for you, it's about the gross margin. When we think about if component prices start to stabilize, seeing how Apple services have been so successful and accretive to margins, should we start to look for some potential margin, gross margin upside, again, should components stabilize? Thank you, gentlemen.\",\n",
       "    \"Jim, on the gross margin side, I think I'll repeat what I said earlier. You're right. Our services business, and I've said it in the past, is accretive to company margins. And so, as we are able to grow the services business, that should provide a positive tailwind. At the same time, within the services portfolio that we have, we have services that have different levels of profitability, so we also need to take into account the mix of services that we're going to be selling. At a macro level, because about two-thirds of our company is outside the United States, a weak dollar is a positive for our gross margins. A strong dollar, as it's been during the last four years, has been a bit of a headwind for the company. We try to make it more stable through the hedging program.\",\n",
       "    \"And in general, when we look at our process to innovate our products, typically when we launch a new product, that product tends to have a higher cost structure than the product it replaces. And so, that is something that we need to work through every time we launch a new product, and we have a pretty good track record and history of taking those cost structures down over time. So, we need to balance all these different elements. I think we've done a pretty remarkable job during the last several years at managing all these different variables and coming out with a level of gross margins that we think is really good for investors, and certainly, it is our plan to continue to manage them that way. But it's very difficult for me to give you a prediction of where gross margins are gonna be six months or 12 months from now.\",\n",

       "    \"Thanks, Nancy, and thanks you everyone on the call, and welcome to everyone today. Before we dive into the quarter, I'd like to take a moment to talk about a significant milestone we recently crossed. Apple's Active Installed Base reached 1.3 billion devices in January and is at an all-time high for all of our major products. One point three billion devices represents an astonishing 30% growth in just two years. It speaks to the strength and reliability of our products and our ecosystem as well as the loyalty, satisfaction, and engagement of our customers. It's also fueling tremendous growth in our services business, which I'll talk about a little later in the call.\",\n",
       "    \"Turning to the December quarter, we're thrilled to report Apple's biggest quarter ever, which set new all-time records in both revenue and earnings. We generated revenue of $88.3 billion, which is above the high end of our guidance range, and it is up almost $10 billion or 13% over the previous all-time record we set a year ago. It's also our fifth consecutive quarter of accelerating revenue growth, with double-digit growth in each of our geographic segments around the world.\",\n",
       "    \"What makes us even more remarkable is that the quarter we're reporting today was 13 weeks long, while the year-ago quarter was 14 weeks. When we look at the average revenue per week in the December quarter this year compared to last year, our growth was a stunning 21%.\",\n",
       "    'Our growth was broad-based, and a key driver was iPhone, which generated its highest revenue ever. iPhone X was the best-selling smartphone in the world in the December quarter according to Canalys, and it has been our top-selling phone every week since it launched.',\n",
       "    'iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus rounded out the top three iPhones in the quarter. In fact, revenue for our newly launched iPhone was the highest of any lineup in our history, driving total Apple revenue above our guidance range.',\n",
       "    'I want to take a moment to recognize the tremendous amount of work that went into creating iPhone X. Our teams carried out an extremely complex launch from both an engineering and operations perspective, executing an outstanding product ramp that required years of research and development. One that introduced innovative features like an edge-to-edge super retina display, and the TrueDepth camera which enables Face ID. Our customers love these new features, and the new gestures like simply swiping up from the bottom, which made using iPhone even more intuitive and enjoyable.',\n",
       "    \"Our team has put the technology of tomorrow in our customers' hands today, set the standard for the next decade of smartphones, and we are very proud of their achievements.\",\n",
       "    \"It was another very strong quarter for services, with revenue of $8.5 billion, up 18% over last year, and we're on pace to achieve our goal of doubling our 2016 services revenue by 2020. The number of paid subscriptions across our services offerings passed 240 million by the end of the December quarter. That's an increase of 30 million in the last 90 days alone, which is the largest quarterly growth ever.\",\n",
       "    \"We had an all-time record quarter for the app store, with our best holiday season ever. We've seen great excitement around augmented reality, with customers now enjoying over 2,000 ARKit-enabled apps spanning every category of apps in the App Store. In December, when Pokémon Go released its new augmented reality features built with ARKit, it jumped to the top of the App Store charts.\",\n",
       "    \"Last week, on a stop in Toronto, I met developers who are hard at work on creative applications using ARKit, from art appreciation to e-commerce, and I was very impressed with what I saw. Just four months after ARKit launched to the public, we've already released ARKit 1.5 in beta to developers around the world, and the response has been tremendous. Augmented reality is going to revolutionize many of the experiences we have with mobile devices, and with ARKit, we're giving developers the most advanced tools on the market to create apps for the most advanced operating system running on the most advanced hardware. This is something only Apple can do.\",\n",
       "    \"In addition to the App Store, several other services had their biggest quarter ever, including Apple Music, iCloud, and Apple Pay, all of which saw growth in both active users and revenue. Apple Pay has reached an important milestone in the US. As the result of 50% year-over-year growth in merch adoption, it's now accepted at more than half of all American retail locations, which includes more than two thirds of the country's top 100 retailers.\",\n",
       "    \"Now available in 20 markets, global Apple Pay purchase volume more than tripled year-over-year, and we're delighted to be expanding to Brazil in the coming months.\",\n",

In the US, we launched Apple Pay Cash in December, and it's off to a terrific start. Millions of people are already using it to send and receive money with friends and family quickly, easily, and securely to split a bill, pay someone back, or send a last-minute gift right from the Messages app.\",\n",
       "    'It was our best quarter ever for the Apple Watch, with over 50% growth in revenue and units for the fourth quarter in a row, and strong double-digit growth in every geographic segment. Sales of Apple Watch Series 3 models were also more than twice the volume of Series 2 a year ago. Apple Watch is the most popular smart watch in the world and gained market share during the quarter based on the latest estimates from IDC.',\n",
       "    'It was the third consecutive quarter of growth for iPad revenue thanks to the strength of both iPad and iPad Pro. Based on the latest data from IDC, we gained share in nearly every market we track, with strong outperformance in emerging markets.',\n",

It's an entirely new product line designed for our pro users who love the all-in-one design of iMac and require workstation class performance. It's the fastest, most powerful Mac ever, delivering incredible computational power for simulation and real-time 3D rendering, immersive VR, and complex photography, audio, and video projects.

       "    \"We believe one of the key issues of the 21st century is education, and because of that, we've strengthened our commitment and investment into initiatives like Everyone Can Code. To find the innovators of the future, we need to nurture the students of today. Our app development with Swift curriculum, which is available free on iBooks, has been downloaded more than 1.2 million times worldwide, with more than half of those coming from here in the United States. It's also being taught in dozens of community colleges across the country, putting practical skills in the hands of today's job seekers.\",\n",
       "    \"I was in London two weeks ago as we announced that the program was expanding to more than 70 colleges and universities in Europe.

       "    'As you know, the December quarter a year ago spanned 14 weeks compared to 13 weeks this year, which is important to consider as we assess the underlying performance of our business this year. When we look at average revenue per week, our growth rate was even higher at 21% with growth across all product categories for the third consecutive quarter.',\n",
       "    'Our results were terrific all around the world, with double-digit revenue growth in all our geographic segments, and all-time quarterly records in the vast majority of markets we track including the US, Western Europe, Japan, Canada, Australia, and Korea, as well as mainland China, Latin America, the Middle East, central and eastern Europe, and India. In Greater China, we were very happy to generate double-digit revenue growth for the second quarter in a row, and in emerging markets outside of Greater China we saw 25% year-over-year growth.',\n",
       "    'Gross margin was 38.4% of the high end of our guidance range. Operating margin was 29.8% of revenue. Our net income was 20.1 billion, an all-time record and up 2.2 billion over last year.',\n",
       "    'Diluted earnings per share were $3.89, also an all-time record, and cash flow from operations was very strong, up 28.3 billion.',\n",
       "    'During the quarter, we sold 77.3 million iPhones, the highest number ever for a 13-week quarter. Average weekly iPhone sales were up 6% compared to December quarter last year, with growth in every region of the world despite the staggered launch of iPhone X. We established all-time iPhone revenue records in nearly every market we track and double-digit growth in all of our geographic segments.',\n",
       "    'iPhone ASP increased to $796, from $695 a year ago, driven primarily by the launch of iPhone X and the success of iPhone 8 and 8 Plus.',\n",
       "    'We exited the December quarter toward the lower end of our target range of five to seven weeks of iPhone channel inventory, with less than 1 million less iPhones in the channel compared to the December quarter a year ago, in line with our goals in average weekly unit sales.',\n",
       "    'Customer interest and satisfaction with iPhone are very, very strong for both consumers and business users. The latest data from 451 Research indicates US customer satisfaction ratings of 96% or higher across iPhone models. In fact, combining iPhone 8, iPhone 8 Plus, and iPhone X, consumers reported an amazing 99% satisfaction rating. Among business customers planning to purchase smartphones in the next quarter, 77% plan to purchase iPhone.',\n",
       "    \"Our customers are also incredibly loyal, with Kantar's latest US research reflecting a 96% iPhone loyalty rate, the highest ever measured.\",\n",
       "    'Turning to services, we had a terrific quarter with revenue of 8.5 billion, up 18% year-over-year, and up 27% in terms of average revenue per week. That is an acceleration to the 24% services growth run rate that we experienced in the September quarter.',\n",
       "    \"The App Store set a new all-time revenue record. The store's all-new design is off to a fantastic start, with quarterly store visitors, transaction accounts, and paying accounts reaching new all-time highs. During the week beginning December 24, a record number of customers made purchases or downloaded apps from the app store, spending over 890 million in that 7-day period, followed by 300 million in purchases on New Year's Day alone.\",\n",
       "    \"According to App Annie's latest report, the App Store continues to be the preferred destination for customer purchases by a very wide margin, generating nearly twice the revenue of Google Play.\",\n",
       "    'Across all of our services offerings, paid subscriptions reached 240 million with growth of 58% over last year, and they were a major contributor to the overall strong growth in services revenue.',\n",
       "    'As Tim mentioned, it was our best quarter ever for Apple Watch, and when we add the results from Beats and AirPods, our total revenue from wearables was up almost 70% year-over-year. In fact, wearables were the second-largest contributors to revenue growth after iPhone, which is impressive for a business that started only three years ago.',\n",
       "    'In total, our Other Products category set a new all-time record with quarterly revenue exceeding $5 billion for the first time.',\n",
       "    \"Next, I'd like to talk about the Mac. We sold 5.1 million Macs during the December quarter, which translates to a 2% year-over-year increase in average sales per week. Mac performance was particularly strong in emerging markets, with unit sales up 15% year-over-year and with all-time records in Latin America, in India, Turkey, and central and eastern Europe. On a worldwide basis, the active installed base of Macs was up double-digits year-over-year to a new record.\",\n",
       "    \"It was also another growth quarter for iPad. We sold 13.2 million units with average iPad sales per week up 8% over last year's December quarter. iPad sales drew strong double-digits in many emerging markets including Latin America, the Middle East, central and eastern Europe, and India, as well as developed markets including Japan, Australia, and Korea.\",\n",
       "    'The active installed base of iPad has grown every quarter since its launch in 2010, and it reached a new all-time high in December thanks to extremely high customer loyalty and large numbers of first-time iPad users.',\n",
       "    'NPD indicates that iPad has 46% share of the US tablet market in the December quarter, up from 36% share a year ago, and the most recent surveys from 451 Research found that among customers planning to purchase tablets within 90 days, 72% of consumers and 68% of business users plan to purchase iPads. Customer satisfaction is also very high, with businesses reporting a 99% satisfaction rating for iPad.',\n",
       "    \"We're seeing great traction in enterprise as businesses across industries and around the world standardize in iOS. For example, Intesa Sanpaolo, one of Europe's leading banks, has chosen iOS as the mobile standard for its entire 70,000 employee base in Italy. Choosing iOS for its security, user interface, accessibility, and reliability. Intesa Sanpaolo will deploy native apps to improve employee productivity in customer support, human resources, and marketing across the company.\",\n",
       "    'At LensCrafters, one of the largest optical retail brands in North America, will be using over 7,000 iPad Pros to enable digital eye exams and digital optical measurements in a personalized, interactive experience.',\n",
       "    \"We're also rolling out a new initiative called Apple At Work to help businesses implement employee-choice programs more easily and offer Apple products company wide. Resources from both Apple and our channel partners will enable enterprise IT and procurement teams to buy or lease Apple products more efficiently, streamline the setup of iPhone Eye for the Mac, and deliver a seamless, onboarding experience for employees. We launched the program with CDW in the US last week, and we will be expanding to more channels and regions later this year.\",\n",
       "    'The December quarter was extremely busy for our retail and online stores, which welcomed 538 million visitors. Traffic was particularly strong during the full weeks following the launch of iPhone X, up 46% over last year, and across the quarter, our stores conducted over 200,000 Today at Apple sessions covering topics including photography, music, gaming and app development, and art and design.',\n",
       "    \"Just last weekend, we opened our first store in Seoul, Korea, and we're looking forward to opening our first store in Austria in a few weeks. These newest openings will mark the expansion of our retail source presence to 21 countries.\",\n",
       "    'Let me now turn to our cash position. We ended the quarter with 285.1 billion in cash plus marketable securities, a sequential increase of 16.2 billion. Two hundred and sixty-nine billion of this cash, or 94% of the total was outside the United States.',\n",
       "    \"We issued 7 billion in debt during the quarter, bringing us to 110 billion in term debt and 12 billion in commercial paper outstanding for a total net cash position of 163 billion at the end of the quarter. We also returned 14.5 billion to investors during the quarter. We paid 3.3 billion in dividends and equivalents, and spent 5.1 billion on repurchases of 30.2 million Apple shares to open market transactions. We launched a new $5 billion-dollar ASR program, resulting in initial delivery and retirement of 23.6 million shares, and we'll retire 3.8 million shares upon the completion of our 12th ASR during the quarter.\",\n",
       "    'We have now completed over 248 billion of our 300 billion capital return program including 176 billion in share repurchases against our announced 210 billion buyback program with 34 billion remaining under our current authorization.',\n",
       "    'Turning to taxes, due to the recently enacted legislation in the US, we estimate making a corporate income tax payment of approximately $38 billion to the US government on our accumulative past foreign earnings. This amount is very similar to what we have been accruing on those earnings in our financial results through fiscal year 2017. Including the 38 billion payment, we will have paid over $110 billion of corporate income tax on our total domestic and foreign earnings during the last 10 years, for a cash tax rate of about 26%.',\n",
       "    'Our tax rate of 25.8% for the December quarter was close to our guidance of 25.5% at the lower US pass-through rate from the new legislation was effectively offset by the remeasurement of the deferred tax balances.',\n",
       "    \"As we move ahead into the March quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call. We expect revenue to be between 60 and 62 billion. We expect gross margin to be between 38% and 38.5%. We expect opex to be between 7.6 billion and 7.7 billion. We expect OI&E to be about 300 million, and we expect our tax rate to be about 15%.\",\n",
       "    'Tax reform will allow us to pursue a more optimal capital structure for our company. Our current net cash position is $163 billion, and given the increased financial and operational flexibility from the access to our foreign cash, we are targeting to become approximately net cash neutral over time. We will provide an update to our specific capital allocation plans when we report results for our second fiscal quarter consistent with the timing of our updates that we have provided in the past.',\n",
       "    'Finally, today our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.63 per share of common stock, payable on February 15, 2018, to shareholders of record as of February 12, 2018.',\n",
       "    \"With that, I'd like to open the call to questions.\",\n",
       "    'Thank you, Luca. We ask that you limit yourself to one 1-part question and one follow-up. May we have the first question, please?',\n",
       "    'Questions and Answers:',\n",
       "    'Thank you. Our first question will come from Shannon Cross with Cross Research.',\n",
       "    \"Thank you very much for taking my question. Luca, wanted to talk a little bit more about your comments on capital structure. I realize you don't want to give us any specifics about what you're actually going to return and the timing, but just maybe if you could talk about how much cash I guess you think you need to have to run the business, and then in terms of ongoing cash flow, since the overseas cash will no longer be encumbered, does that change your thought process in general? And then I have a follow-up. Thank you.\",\n",
       "    \"Sure, Shannon. Of course, you know, we've been talking about the importance of tax reform over the years because we believe it's really beneficial to the US economy. What it means to us as a company, of course, is that we have additional flexibility right now from the access to the foreign cash. In the past, we've been addressing this issue by having to raise debt as the cash was overseas, the majority of the cash was overseas.\",\n",
       "    \"So, we are now in a position where we have $285 billion of cash. We've got $122 billion of debt, for a net cash of $163 billion. We have now the flexibility to deploy this capital. We will do that over time because the amount is very large. As I said earlier, we will be discussing capital allocation plans when we review our March quarter results, and when you look at our track record of what we've done over the last several years, you've seen that effectively we were returning to our investors essentially about 100% of our free cash flow. And so, that is the approach that we're gonna be taking. We're gonna be very thoughtful and deliberate about it. Obviously, we want to make the right decisions in the best interest of our long-term shareholders.\",\n",
       "    \"Great. Thank you, and then Tim, maybe, could you talk a little bit more about what you're hearing from customers in terms of the iPhone demand? How you're thinking about the potential decay rate, for lack of a better term, you know, with the high-end phones and the over-a-thousand-dollar phones versus balancing that with now your ability to ship phones down below $400 because you'd expanded the product line so much when you launched your phones in 2017? Thank you.\",\n",
       "    \"Yeah. Thank you, Shannon, for the question. The revenue growth from iPhone across all the geographic segments was in the double digits, and I think as Luca said earlier, when you change that to an average weekly sales basis, it's actually 22%. So, it was a stellar quarter for iPhone. The iPhone X was the most popular, and that's particularly noteworthy given that we didn't start shipping until early November and were constrained for a while. The team did a great job of getting into supply/demand balance there in December. But since the launch of iPhone X, it has been the most popular iPhone every week, every week since. That is even true today, actually, through January.\",\n",
       "    \"We feel fantastic about the results. The most important thing for us isn't really the numbers, though. It's customer satisfaction, and customer satisfaction is literally off the charts on iPhone X. We think about the advances in technology that were a part of the iPhone X, we went from Touch ID to Face ID. Face ID has been incredibly well received. The wireless charging. The edge-to-edge super retina display, and totally new gestures. The user experience is different, and so it's great to get that kind of feedback.\",\n",
       "    \"Now, if you look at the sort of the overall iPhone line, which gets to the essence of the question, I think, I looked, I reviewed the top mini-markets. I'll talk briefly about the top four. In urban China and the US, the top five smartphones last quarter were all iPhones, and in Japan and the UK, six of the top seven were iPhones. And so in a market that is as large as the smartphone market is, people want some level of choice in their deciding which ones to buy, but we feel fantastic particularly as pertains to iPhone X.\",\n",
       "    'Thank you, Shannon. Could we have the next question, please?',\n",
       "    \"Next, we'll go to Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley.\",\n",
       "    'Thank you. Good afternoon. Growing double digits off such a large revenue base is impressive in itself, but if I look at March quarter guidance, it does assume a slower average weekly growth in total revenue as well as I think, my math, I found shipments when you compare it to the December quarter. So, just how should we read into a modest slowdown in average weekly growth as it relates to the last question around the decay of demand around the higher-priced products, or any impact that you might be seeing from the lower-priced battery replacements or anything else in the market? Then I have a follow-up.',\n",
       "    \"Katy, I'll take the question. You know, we are guiding to 62 billion. It's strong double-digit growth, 13 to 17%. In context, it's $7\\xad to 9 billion above last year. So, when you put things in perspective and you add the $10 billion of growth that we had in the first quarter, and the 7 to 9 billion that we're guiding to for the second quarter, you're talking about $17 to 19 billion of growth in six months. This is at the macro level.\",\n",
       "    \"We typically don't go into this level of detail, but think it's important this quarter to give you additional color, and maybe the two most important messages are that we believe iPhone revenue will grow double digits as compared to last year during the March quarter, and also and importantly that iPhone sell-through growth on a year-over-year basis, would be actually accelerating during the March quarter as compared to the December quarter.\",\n",
       "    'Let me explain the factors that we took into consideration as we came up with our iPhone units and AHD that are embedded into our guidance. Historically, because of the channel fill and holiday season, our selling volume during the December quarter is generally higher than sell-through. This year, the difference was further magnified because we shipped iPhone X in November rather than the September quarter. We had a very successful product ramp. We were able to reach supply/demand balance in December, which placed the entirety of our channel fill for iPhone X in Q1, and this will have an effect on both units and ASP in Q2.',\n",
       "    'Now, for units, there is a second point to consider. We typically reduce channel inventory for our newest iPhones in Q2 because they enjoy very large demand in the initial weeks of sales, which are compounded by the holiday season in Q1. So, we anticipate doing that in Q2 this year as well.',\n",
       "    \"For ASP, there's also another element that we need to consider. As you know, our newest products this year have higher ASPs than they've had in the past, and so as a result, as we reduce inventories of these newest products, the overall ASPs for iPhone in Q2 will naturally decline sequentially by a higher percentage than we have experienced historically.\",\n",
       "    \"So, in summary, our guidance for iPhone, we got double-digit year-over-year growth, and acceleration of sell-through growth on a year-over-year basis. For the balance of the company in the aggregate, we expect to grow strong double digits year-over-year and particularly very strong performance in service and in wearables like we'd seen during the December quarter. Hope this helps.\",\n",
       "    \"Yeah. That's great color. Just a follow-up on gross margin. Guidance for flat gross margin in March is pretty seasonal, but you do have the tailwind from currency. So, if you could just comment on how you think that flows into the model of the next couple of quarters, the weaker dollar, and what your outlook might be around component costs in the near future. Thank you.\",\n",
       "    \"Yeah. Let me walk you through the sequential first. So, we got in about flat sequentially in spite of the loss of leverage. Right? That is the largest element that we need to take into account because of our typical seasonality. We expect to offset the seasonality impact with cost improvements and[inaudible]. Effect on a sequential basis is fairly new because as you know we've got a hedging program that protects us from the volatility of currencies in the short term. Certainly, weaker dollar in the long term if it holds, will be a positive, but it's not something that you're gonna be seeing translate into gross margin tailwind quickly, and so I think we have to keep that in mind.\",\n",
       "    'We also need to keep in mind that we continue to experience a difficult memory tracking environment, which we think is gonna start improving as we move into the second half of our fiscal year, but it still has a negative impact in the March quarter.',\n",
       "    'Thank you, Katy. Can we have the next question, please?',\n",
       "    'Certainly. Mike Olson from Piper Jaffray has our next question.',\n",
       "    \"Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. I know you don't talk about future products, which is often the preface to questions about future products, but I'll give it a shot. When you think conceptually about the path for iPhone X-style devices going forward, is there any reason the roadmap wouldn't consist of multiple devices as we've seen with past iPhone upgrades? In other words, the X was unique among recent iPhone launches because it's a singular device, potentially limiting the shots on goals for upgrades given limited options. How do you think about that going forward? And then, I have a follow-up.\",\n",
       "    \"Mike, you did a good job of answering your question, I think, at the beginning. We don't really comment on future products, but I would tell you that we're thrilled with the reception to iPhone X. As we said when we launched it, we were setting up the next decade, and that is how we looked at it, and so that's the reason it's chocked full of incredible innovation, so you can bet that we're pulling that stray.\",\n",
       "    \"Alright, and then, how do you think about AR beyond the iPhone? You've created the world's largest AR platform. You got developers generating a wide variety of apps. I realize it's still early days, but do you see Apple as a provider of a larger ecosystem of AR-enabled devices beyond the iPhone and iPad in the coming years? Or should investors focus on the opportunity within your existing device portfolio for at least the foreseeable future? Thanks.\",\n",
       "    \"I see AR as being profound. I think it's—AR has the ability to amplify human performance instead of isolating humans, and so I am a huge, huge believer in AR. We put a lot of energy on AR. We're moving very fast. We've gone from ARKit 1.0 to 1.5 in just a matter of months. I couldn't be happier with the rate and pace of the developer community, how fast they're developing new things. I don't wanna say, you know, what we may do, but I could not be happier with how things are goin' right now.\",\n",
       "    'Thank you.',\n",
       "    'Thank you, Mike. Could we have the next question, please?',\n",
       "    \"Next, we'll go to Toni Sacconaghi from Bernstein.\",\n",
       "    \"Yes, thank you. I have a question and a follow-up. You commented on how your installed base over the last couple of years has grown 30%, and iPhone is clearly the largest component of that, and so iPhone's installed base is probably growing close to that number, perhaps less. Let's call it 20% or 25. Yet if we look at iPhone unit growth for Fiscal '18, sort of what's implied with your guidance, Fiscal '17 and Fiscal '16, it's been relatively flat. So you have an installed base that's 20+% higher and a unit growth that's relatively flat, which would suggest that your upgrade rate is going down or your replacement cycle is elongating. I'm wondering whether you agree with that and whether investors should be worried about that.\",\n",
       "    \"Maybe if I could just add one other wrinkle to potentially get your response on is, given consumers' heightened awareness of their ability to replace batteries going forward as opposed to upgrade, isn't that also something that investors should potentially be concerned about in terms of its impact on upgrade rates going forward? And then, believe it or not, I have a follow-up.\",\n",
       "    \"Because iPhone has the largest residual rate on it, it acts as a buffer for the customer for to buy a new one, and it winds up with another customer somewhere else that is perfectly fine with having a previously owned iPhone. So, I view all of that to be incredibly positive. It's more people on iPhones, the better. I would like to point out that the every major product hit a high on the active installed base, and so that's iPads, it's Mac, and you know, those are huge numbers as well. As we've always said, there's a large part of the, or the vast majority of the services kinda are mapped to the installed base instead of the quarterly sales, and this quarter really is no different on that.\",\n",
       "    'Thanks for that.',\n",
       "    \"On the battery, Toni, we did not consider in any way, shape, or form what it would do to upgrade rates. We did it because we thought it was the right thing to do for our customers, and I, sitting here today, I don't know what effect it will have. Again, it's not, it was not in our thought process of deciding to do what was done.\",\n",
       "    \"Okay. Thank you for that. Just to follow-up, maybe I could clarify two little things. One, Luca, on tax rate, you talked about 15% for Q2. Is that how we should think about the tax rate on an ongoing basis? And then, just back to you on your response, Tim, I guess maybe you could just comment on whether you believe the upgrade rate has decreased over the last couple of years. Because, again, it's just sort of mechanically, installed base is growing 20 and units are relatively flat over that period, isn't that telling the installed base is—wait, excuse me. Upgrade rate is going down, or am I not thinking about other considerations? Thank you.\",\n",
       "    \"On the tax rate, I will make two comments. First of all, the new tax law in the United States is complex, and I think we, as many other companies, are really trying to absorb what this all means. I think we're gonna be receiving over the next few months implementation guidance. So, we've taken some provisional estimates in coming up with our tax entries for the quarter, and we will have to do that as we go forward here during the year. So, it may be a bit bumpy in the short term as we understand the law in full and it actually gets explained in full.\",\n",
       "    \"But I would say that, for the current fiscal year, the guidance that we provided for Q2 should be approximately what you should be seeing. As we get into the new fiscal year, so many things change, and we need to take that into account, you know, the geographic mix of our products and so on. But I would say for the remainder of the year, it's what we're guiding to.\",\n",
       "    \"I think on the replacement cycle, Toni, the answers probably look different by geography. In those geographies that had, in the early days of the smartphone market had very traditional subsidies where you paid 199 out the door, 99 or whatever. I think it's accurate to say those type of markets, the replacement cycle is likely longer. Where that isn't the case, I'm not nearly as sure on that. I would point out that that's happened some time ago, and so it's very difficult currently to ever get a real-time handle on replacement rate, because you obviously don't know the replacement rate for the product you're currently selling. You only know that in an historical sense. So, it's not something that we overly fixate on.\",\n",
       "    'Thank you, Toni. Can we have the next question, please?',\n",
       "    'That question comes from Laura Martin from Needham.',\n",
       "    'Hi there, guys.[Inaudible]advice that you gave us updating from two years ago.[Inaudible]you spread out the pricing. Do you get the sense that we have more unique users in that 1.3 billion than we had unique users back there in 2016?',\n",
       "    \"Laura, I'm sorry. I missed the first part of that. You broke up on the phone.\",\n",
       "    'Okay. So, we have a billion-3[inaudible]unique users[inaudible]fewer products, so we have a higher percent of users in the billion-3 devices than were in the[inaudible].',\n",
       "    \"Laura, you're cutting in and out, but I'm gonna take a swing at what I think you're asking. I think you're asking are there more active users today than there were two years ago when we had a billion active devices, and the answer is absolutely. There are many, many, many more.\",\n",
       "    \"Yeah, I was asking as a percent. The ownership used to be 1.4 devices owned per person. Do you think it's now 1.2 or 1.6?\",\n",
       "    \"Well, that 1.4, I don't know where that came from. It did not come from Apple, and so that's one of those things that kinda flowed out there, and I wanna divorce Apple from that number. We're not releasing a user number because we think that the proper way to look at it is to look at active devices. It's also the one that is the most accurate for us to measure, and so that's our thinking behind that.\",\n",
       "    'Okay. Switchers, in the quarter? You often give us switchers.',\n",
       "    \"It is so early on this product cycle, particularly with the iPhone X only starting in November, that we do not feel we have data at this point that would be very meaningful to share, and so I'll punt that question until next time around.\",\n",
       "    'Thank you, Laura. Could we have the next question, please?',\n",
       "    \"Next, we'll go to Steve Milunovich from UBS.\",\n",
       "    \"Thank you very much. Tim, you said you don't want to tell investors what to do, but the first point you made was talking about the size of the installed base. Later you talked about the importance of customer satisfaction. Given that this doesn't look like a super cycle in terms of unit growth, are you nudging us to focus on the size of the installed base via annuity opportunity here, and do you have confidence that you can monetize that installed base through additional hardware and services?\",\n",
       "    \"What I said in the investor part is I think every investor has to look at their own situation and conclude the things that they think are important. What I think is important, I think the active devices are hugely important, and that's the reason that we released the number two years ago and the reason that we're releasing that again today. That number speaks to the strength of the product, the loyalty of the customer, the strength of the ecosystem, and so we do put a lot of weight behind that. It obviously also fuels the services business. So, I have long believed that a 90-day clock on unit sales is a very surface way to view Apple. I think that the far bigger thing is to look over a longer period of time in customer satisfaction and engagement and number of active devices or all or part of that.\",\n",
       "    \"Thanks, and could you address the positioning of HomePod? What category is it in? Is it a music speaker? Is it a home assistant, since people seem to be trying to position it versus Amazon and Google's offerings? And is the target market primarily Apple Music users?\",\n",
       "    'HomePod is an incredible product that gives a unbelievable audio experience in a very small form factor with a super assistant, digital assistant in Siri that knows an enormous amount about music, but also can handle requests to, like, home automation to close your garage door, open your door, turn the light on, turn the fireplace on, change the thermostat. All of the things that you would like to do in home automation, but takes it further because you can do it right from the Home app and set up scenes.',\n",
       "    'So you can say, you know, \"Hey, Siri, I\\'m reading,\" and your room would change to the things you would like happening in that particular room, and so on and so forth. It also, obviously you can also do things with HomePod, like use it as a speaker phone. So, if you\\'re talking to your parents or they\\'re talking to their grandkids, it\\'s unbelievable audio quality for speaker phone. You can also have Siri call for you. You can send messages. You can get a Uber car or a Lyft car, and so there\\'s just a whole variety of things.',\n",
       "    'I think the use cases on this, much like our phones, will be broad based. Some people will use it significantly for music, and others may use it significantly for, as, a digital assistant, and I think the majority of people will likely use all of it, and use all of the functionality of it.',\n",

I think growth was up double digits year over year, but essentially in line with what you saw in September, I would have thought it would have created a little bit for the iPhone X? Just to put some things in China would be great.\",\n",
       "    \"Yeah, Amit, it's Tim. That's a good question. Keep in mind that this year had 13 weeks, last year had 14 weeks. And so, even though we're reporting a similar year-over-year growth for China, if you change that reporting to an average weekly sales, which is probably a much better way to look at it, there was actually a really nice acceleration in specifically the numbers this quarter as reported are 11% increase for greater China year over year, but on an average weekly revenue basis, we were at 19%.\",\n",
       "    \"Also, mainland China, we had an all-time record for revenue in mainland China. Of course, a key part of that was iPhone, and as I'd mentioned before, Kantar reported that the top five selling smartphones in urban China were all iPhones. We could not be more pleased with how we're doing, and if you look at the other—we obviously grew share on for iPhone in the quarter, but we also grew share in iPad and Mac during the quarter, and wearables were extremely strong there in the quarter. And so, everywhere I look, I feel really good about how we're doing in China.\",\n",
       "    \"Let me answer starting with MNA. Our thought process around MNA has always been the same, and really, it really doesn't change. We've been acquiring companies over the years. During calendar 2017, we've acquired 19 companies, and the thought process is always acquire something that allows us to either accelerate our product roadmaps, filling a gap in our portfolio, providing a new experience to customers. It's always with the customer experience in mind, right, that we make acquisitions. We look at all sizes, and we will continue to do so. We have plenty of financial flexibility, of course. We had that even prior to tax reform, and as I said, we would talk about capital allocation plans when we reported the March quarter, and that will include talking about timeframes and pace and so on. As I said, we try to be very thoughtful. As you said, 163 billion is a large amount, and there are even practical considerations around it. So, we'll see.\",\n",
